\section{Wake Fields and Wake Functions}

Wake fields are the electromagnetic fields generated by a particle and its environments when it travels with constant velocity througth the vacuum chamber. Thus:

\begin{align}
\begin{matrix}
\vect{E}(\vect{r},\vect{r_p},t)\
\vect{B}(\vect{r},\vect{r_p},t)
\end{matrix}
\Rightarrow
\begin{matrix}
\vect{\Delta} \cdot \vect{E} = -\partial{\vect{B}}  = 

The interaction of the beam with the environment is weak when compared to the external fields, or guiding fields, generated by the magnets and other components of the ring and can be treated with the impulse approximation. In this approach,
