  abstract	= {<p>Some of the characteristics of recent
		  ultralow-emittance storage-ring designs and possibly future
		  diffraction-limited storage rings are a compact lattice
		  combined with small magnet apertures. Such requirements
		  present a challenge for the design and performance of the
		  vacuum system. The vacuum system should provide the
		  required vacuum pressure for machine operation and be able
		  to handle the heat load from synchrotron radiation. Small
		  magnet apertures result in the conductance of the chamber
		  being low, and lumped pumps are ineffective. One way to
		  provide the required vacuum level is by distributed
		  pumping, which can be realised by the use of a
		  non-evaporable getter (NEG) coating of the chamber walls.
		  It may not be possible to use crotch absorbers to absorb
		  the heat from the synchrotron radiation because an
		  antechamber is difficult to realise with such a compact
		  lattice. To solve this, the chamber walls can work as
		  distributed absorbers if they are made of a material with
		  good thermal conductivity, and distributed cooling is used
		  at the location where the synchrotron radiation hits the
		  wall. The vacuum system of the 3 GeV storage ring of

		  to those designing accelerators as drivers for
		  free-electron lasers (FELs). Although experimental evidence

		  effects on the emittance of high-brightness electron beams.
		  The performance of an FEL depends critically on the
		  emittance, current, and energy spread of the beam. Attempts
		  to increase the current through magnetic bunch compression
		  can lead to increased emittance and energy spread due to
		  CSR in the dipoles of such a compressor. The code ELEGANT

		  rings. This result can be understood in terms of the
		  long-range quadrupolar wakes of noncircular vacuum chambers
		  with finite resistivity. In vacuum chambers with circular
		  cross section, the dominant transverse wake driven by a
		  leading particle and seen by a trailing test particle is
		  dipolar and is proportional only to the transverse offset

		  oscillatory factors. On the other hand, quadrupolar wakes
		  are independent of the offset of the driving particle, and
		  thus the contributions of preceding bunches and turns are
		  strictly additive. Since quadrupole fields are focusing in
		  one plane and defocusing in the plane orthogonal to it,
		  their effects on tune shifts in these planes have opposite
		  signs. Their cumulative effect also explains the large

  abstract	= {A small vacuum chamber aperture is a present trend in the
		  design of future synchrotron light sources. This leads to a
		  large resistive-wall impedance that can drive coupled-bunch
		  instabilities. Another trend is the use of passively driven
		  cavities at a harmonic of the main radio frequency to
		  lengthen the electron bunches in order to increase the
		  Touschek lifetime and reduce emittance blowup due to
		  intrabeam scattering. In some cases, the harmonic cavities
		  may be tuned to fulfill the flat potential condition.With
		  this condition met, it has been predicted in simulation
		  that the threshold current for coupled-bunch resistive-
		  wall instabilities is much higher than with no bunch
		  lengthening at all. In this paper, the features of a bunch
		  in the flat potential that would contribute toward this
		  stabilization are identified and discussed. The threshold
		  currents for these instabilities are estimated for the MAX
		  IV 3 GeV storage ring at different values of chromaticity
		  using macroparticle simulations in the time domain and,
		  within the limits of the existing theory, frequency domain
		  calculations. By comparing the results from these two
		  methods and analyzing the spectra of the dominant head-tail
		  modes, the impact of each of the distinguishing features of
		  a bunch in the flat potential can be explained and
		  quantified in terms of the change in threshold current. It
		  is found that, above a certain chromaticity, the threshold
		  current is determined by the radial structure of the
		  zeroth-order head-tail mode. This happens at a lower
		  chromaticity if the bunch length is longer.},

  abstract	= {<p>The MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring, currently under
		  construction, pursues the goal of low electron beam
		  emittance by using a multi-bend achromat magnet lattice,
		  which is realised by having several consecutive magnet
		  elements precision-machined out of a common solid iron
		  block, 2.3–3.4 m long. With this magnet design
		  solution, instead of having 1320 individual magnets, the
		  MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring is built up using 140
		  integrated `magnet block' units, containing all these
		  magnet elements. Major features of this magnet block design
		  are compactness, vibration stability and that the alignment
		  of magnet elements within each unit is given by the
		  mechanical accuracy of the CNC machining rather than
		  individual field measurement and adjustment. This article
		  presents practical engineering details of implementing this
		  magnet design solution, and mechanical + magnetic field
		  measurement results from the magnet production series. At
		  the time of writing (spring 2014), the production series,
		  which is totally outsourced to industry, is roughly half
		  way through, with mechanical/magnetic QA conforming to

		  point of view simply a collection of known mature
		  production methods and measurement procedures, which can be
		  executed at fixed cost with a low level of risk.</p>},

  abstract	= {In this thesis, the problemof the transverse coupled-bunch
		  instabilities created by the LargeHadron Collider (LHC)
		  beam-coupling impedance, that can possibly limit the
		  machine operation, is addressed thanks to several new
		  theories and tools. A rather complete vision of the
		  problemis proposed here, going fromthe calculation of the
		  impedances and wake functions of individual machine
		  elements, to the beam dynamics study. Firstly, new results
		  are obtained in the theory of the beam-coupling impedance
		  for an axisymmetric two-dimensional structure, generalizing
		  Zotter's theories, and a new general theory is derived for
		  the impedance of an infinite flat two-dimensional
		  structure. Then, a new approach has been found to compute
		  thewake functions fromsuch analytically obtained
		  beam-coupling impedances, over- coming limitations that
		  could be met with standard discrete Fourier
		  transformprocedures. Those results are then used to obtain
		  an impedance andwake function model of the LHC, based on
		  the (resistive-) wall impedances of various contributors
		  (collimators, beamscreens and vacuumpipe) and additional
		  estimations of the geometrical impedance contributions.
		  Finally, the existing code HEADTAIL,which is a
		  macroparticle simulation code for beam dynamics studies
		  with wake fields, is improved to make possible the
		  simulation ofmultibunch trains, and a spectral analysis
		  technique is found to facilitate the analysis of the output
		  given by this code, giving the complex tune shifts of the
		  unstable modes present in a simulation. All those theories
		  and tools are used to obtain new results concerning the LHC
		  transverse coupled-bunch instabilities, demonstrating the
		  rather small impact on coupled-bunch instabilities of the
		  number of bunches in a train when the bunch spacing is
		  fixed, and the existence of coupled-bunch modes with
		  intrabunch motion which are more critical than their
		  single-bunch counterparts. A full verification of the
		  complete procedure (impedance theories, impedance model and
		  simulation code) is also performed by comparing the
		  simulation results with actualmeasurements in the LHC,
		  giving a very good agreement at injection energy and a
		  correct order ofmagnitude at 3.5 TeV/c. In the end, several
		  predictions concerning the beam stability at the future 7
		  TeV/c operation of the machine are performed in the case of
		  50 ns spacing (1404 bunches), revealing that the
		  coupled-bunch transverse mode coupling instability
		  threshold is far above the ultimate bunch intensity but
		  about 20% smaller than its single-bunch counterpart.
		  Stability studies with Landau octupoles at their
		  maximumcurrents reveal that the beam remains stable at
		  nominal intensity withQ? =2 in both planes, provided the
		  particle transverse distributions are Gaussian. At ultimate
		  intensity with eitherQ? =0 orQ? =2, or at nominal
		  intensitywhen the chromaticity is zero, the beam happens to
		  be unstable, even with the octupoles at
		  theirmaximumcurrents.},

		  display (FED), inert gas purification systems, H2 plasma
		  purification, hydrogen species recycling as in the Tokamak
		  Fusion Test Reactor. Among the different Non-Evaporable

		  aim of this investigation was to understand how to optimise
		  three important properties of TiZrV coatings: to achieve
		  the lowest possible activation tem- perature (Ta), and to
		  obtain the highest pumping speed and surface pumping
		  capacity. This objective is important in the context of the
		  Large Hadron Collider (LHC) accelerator, since, before this
		  work, the understanding and the knowledge of the TiZrV
		  coating properties were insufficient to adopt it for this
		  machine. In the present investigation, TiZrV coatings (250
		  samples) of various compositions have been deposited by DC
		  (Direct-Current) diode magnetron sputtering. The influence
		  of the substrate material, substrate roughness, substrate

		  next-generation light sources, such as free-electron lasers
		  (FELs) and diffraction-limited storage rings (DLSRs), the
		  quality requirements for gratings and reflective
		  synchrotron optics, especially mirrors, have significantly
		  increased. These coherence-preserving optical components
		  for high-brightness sources will feature nanoscopic shape
		  accuracies over macroscopic length scales up to 1000 mm.
		  To enable high efficiency in terms of photon flux, such

		  today enables the synthesis of layers on the sub-nanometre
		  precision level over a deposition length of up to
		  1500 mm. Specifically dedicated metrology instrumentation
		  of comparable accuracy has been developed to characterize
		  such optical elements. Second-generation slope-measuring

		  machine (NOM) at the BESSY-II Optics laboratory allow the
		  inspection of up to 1500 mm-long reflective optical
		  components with an accuracy better than 50 nrad r.m.s.
		  Besides measuring the shape on top of the coated mirror, it
		  is of particular interest to characterize the internal
		  material properties of the mirror coating, which is the
		  domain of X-rays. Layer thickness, density and interface
		  roughness of single and multilayer coatings are
		  investigated by means of X-ray reflectometry. In this

		  measuring metrology are shown and the characterization of
		  different types of mirror coating demonstrated.
		  Furthermore, upcoming challenges to the inspection of
		  ultra-precise optical components designed to be used in
		  future FEL and DLSR beamlines are discussed.},

		  with conventional undulator magnets it has the following:
		  (i) full x-ray polarization control.—It may generate
		  varying linear polarized as well as left and right circular
		  polarized x rays with photon flux much higher than existing

		  two alternative estimation methods for charged particle
		  distribution which represent significant improvement over
		  the Monte Carlo cosine expansion used in the 2D code of
		  Bassi et al., designed to simulate coherent synchrotron
		  radiation (CSR) in charged particle beams. The improvement
		  is achieved by employing an alternative beam density
		  estimation to the Monte Carlo cosine expansion. The
		  representation is first binned onto a finite grid, after
		  which two grid-based methods are employed to approximate
		  particle distributions: (i) truncated fast cosine
		  transform; and (ii) thresholded wavelet transform (TWT). We
		  demonstrate that these alternative methods represent a
		  staggering upgrade over the original Monte Carlo cosine
		  expansion in terms of efficiency, while the TWT
		  approximation also provides an appreciable improvement in
		  accuracy. The improvement in accuracy comes from a
		  judicious removal of the numerical noise enabled by the
		  wavelet formulation. The TWT method is then integrated into
		  the CSR code, and benchmarked against the original version.
		  We show that the new density estimation method provides a
		  superior performance in terms of efficiency and spatial

  abstract	= {The Yee finite-difference time domain method (FDTD) is
		  commonly used in wake field and particle-in-cell
		  simulations. However, in accelerator modeling the high
		  energy particles can travel in vacuum faster than their own
		  radiation. This effect is commonly referred to as numerical
		  Cherenkov radiation and is a consequence of numerical grid
		  dispersion. Several numerical approaches are proposed to
		  reduce the dispersion for all angles and for a given
		  frequency range, that justifies itself for domains big in
		  all three directions. On the contrary, in accelerator
		  modeling the transverse dimensions and transverse beam
		  velocity are small, but it is extremely important to
		  eliminate the dispersion error in the well-defined
		  direction of the beam motion for all frequencies. In this
		  paper we propose a new two-level economical conservative
		  scheme for electromagnetic field calculations in three
		  dimensions. The scheme does not have dispersion in the
		  longitudinal direction and is staircase-free (second order
		  convergent). Unlike the FDTD method, it is based on a
		  “transversal-electric/transversal-magnetic”
		  (TE/TM)-like splitting of the field components in time. The
		  scheme assures energy and charge conservation.
		  Additionally, the usage of damping terms allows suppressing
		  high frequency noise generated due to the transverse
		  dispersion and the current fluctuations. The dispersion
		  relation of the damping scheme is analyzed. As numerical
		  examples show, the new scheme is much more accurate on the
		  long-time scale than the conventional FDTD approach. },

		  chambers was first calculated over 40 years ago. The
		  original results were valid for metal vacuum chamber walls
		  which are thick compared to the skin depth at the
		  frequencies of interest. Recently the subject has again
		  become important for beam stability in the LHC where in
		  particular the transverse impedance of the large number of
		  graphite collimators to be installed could severely limit
		  its performance, if the “thick wall” formulae were
		  correct. The frequencies of the slow betatron waves in such
		  a large machine are very low and thus the transverse
		  impedance, originally found to be proportional to the
		  inverse square root of frequency, could lead to
		  instabilities. However, when the skin depth exceeds the
		  wall thickness, the transverse resistive wall impedance is
		  strongly reduced and a number of papers have recently been
		  published to estimate this reduction. However, all of these
		  had restrictions of validity. Here we give a consistent
		  derivation of the general expression for the transverse
		  impedance of walls made of arbitrary materials which are
		  valid at all frequencies. The results are compared with
