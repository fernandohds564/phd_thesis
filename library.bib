abstract = {The equilibrium self-consistent distribution of particles in a{\$}\backslash{\$}nhigh intensity electron synchrotron can be found using the Haissinski{\$}\backslash{\$}nequation and the wake field. At some threshold intensity the bunch{\$}\backslash{\$}nbecomes unstable. However, radiation damping causes the particles to be{\$}\backslash{\$}nconfined and the instability does not necessarily cause loss of{\$}\backslash{\$}nparticles. It was observed in simulations with a very simple wake field{\$}\backslash{\$}nand short bunches, that energy spread and bunch length oscillate in a{\$}\backslash{\$}nsawtooth fashion. We find that this is due to the double-peaked nature{\$}\backslash{\$}nof the stationary distribution. Over many synchrotron oscillations,{\$}\backslash{\$}nparticles diffuse from the head peak to the tail to the point where the{\$}\backslash{\$}ntail peak becomes as large as the head. The two resulting sub-bunches{\$}\backslash{\$}nthen collapse together in less than one synchrotron oscillation, causing{\$}\backslash{\$}na net blow-up in emittance. Radiation damping reduces the emittance and{\$}\backslash{\$}ndiffusion begins again},

The plates are infinite both horizontally and along the direction of the point charge movement. We study the general case where the two plates are made of several layers of linear materials up to infinity in the vertical direction, with no a priori top-bottom symmetry. We find new results for the electromagnetic fields and impedances, generalizing in particular the so-called “Yokoya factors” that are valid under certain conditions only.},

The course was held in Sigtuna, Sweden, from 1 May - 9 June 2007.this is the first time this topic has been selected for a specialized course. Taking into account the number of related applications currently in use in accelerators around the world, it was recognized that such a topic should definitevely be incorporated into the CAS serires of specialized courses. the specific aim of the course was to introduce the participants to the use and programming of Digital Signal processors (DSPs) an Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) evaluation board. The course consisted of lectures in the mornings covering fundamental background knowledge in mathematics, controls theory, design tools, programming hardware platforms, and implementation details. In the afternoons the students split into two groups with people working in pairs. One group worked on problem solving using a PC-based workstation connected to a DSP evaluation board. Half-way through the school, those working on SDPs moved to FPGAs and vice versa. The problems to be solved were of increasing difficulty and all of them were directly related to real and practical realizations currently in use in the accelerator field.},

Accel. 12, 237 (1982) to derive the theoretical model including chromaticity, both dipolar and quadrupolar transverse wakefields, and the effects of damping and diffusion due to the synchrotron radiation.We reduce the problem to a linear matrix equation, whose eigenvalues and eigenvectors determine the collective stability of the beam. We then show that various predictions of the theory agree quite well with results from particle tracking simulations, including the threshold current for transverse instability and the profile of the unstable mode. In particular, we find that predicting collective stability for high energy electron beams at moderate to large values of chromaticity requires the full Fokker- Planck analysis to properly account for the effects of damping and diffusion due to synchrotron radiation.},

abstract = {Multibunch instabilities of a storage ring electron beam occur due to coherent particle oscillations generated through a bunch to bunch coupling via the impedances, deteriorating the beam quality. One cure for multibunch instabilities is Landau damping, i.e., introducing a spread in the oscillation frequencies among the particles of the individual bunches in order to destroy the coherence of the coupled multibunch oscillation. Measurements at ELETTRA have shown that the harmonic sextupole provides Landau damping capable of suppressing transverse multibunch instabilities. The damping is induced by the nonlinear tune spread with amplitude among the electrons within the individual bunches. {\textcopyright} 2003 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The dynamics of charged particles in general linear focusing lattices with quadrupole, skew-quadrupole, dipole, and solenoidal components, as well as torsion of the fiducial orbit and variation of beam energy is parametrized using a generalized Courant-Snyder (CS) theory, which extends the original CS theory for one degree of freedom to higher dimensions. The envelope function is generalized into an envelope matrix, and the phase advance is generalized into a 4D symplectic rotation, or a Uð2Þ element. The 1D envelope equation, also known as the Ermakov-Milne-Pinney equation in quantum mechanics, is generalized to an envelope matrix equation in higher dimensions. Other components of the original CS theory, such as the transfer matrix, Twiss functions, and CS invariant (also known as the Lewis invariant) all have their counterparts, with remarkably similar expressions, in the generalized theory. The gauge group structure of the generalized theory is analyzed. By fixing the gauge freedom with a desired symmetry, the generalized CS parametrization assumes the form of the modified Iwasawa decomposition, whose importance in phase space optics and phase space quantum mechanics has been recently realized. This gauge fixing also symmetrizes the generalized envelope equation and expresses the theory using only the generalized Twiss function {\$}\beta{\$}. The generalized phase advance completely determines the spectral and structural stability properties of a general focusing lattice. For structural stability, the generalized CS theory enables application of the Krein-Moser theory to greatly simplify the stability analysis. The generalized CS theory provides an effective tool to study coupled dynamics and to discover more optimized lattice designs in the larger parameter space of general focusing lattices.},

@article{Qin2014,
abstract = {The dynamics of charged particles in general linear focusing lattices with quadrupole, skew-quadrupole, dipole, and solenoidal components, as well as torsion of the fiducial orbit and variation of beam energy is parametrized using a generalized Courant-Snyder (CS) theory, which extends the original CS theory for one degree of freedom to higher dimensions. The envelope function is generalized into an envelope matrix, and the phase advance is generalized into a 4D symplectic rotation, or a Uð2Þ element. The 1D envelope equation, also known as the Ermakov-Milne-Pinney equation in quantum mechanics, is generalized to an envelope matrix equation in higher dimensions. Other components of the original CS theory, such as the transfer matrix, Twiss functions, and CS invariant (also known as the Lewis invariant) all have their counterparts, with remarkably similar expressions, in the generalized theory. The gauge group structure of the generalized theory is analyzed. By fixing the gauge freedom with a desired symmetry, the generalized CS parametrization assumes the form of the modified Iwasawa decomposition, whose importance in phase space optics and phase space quantum mechanics has been recently realized. This gauge fixing also symmetrizes the generalized envelope equation and expresses the theory using only the generalized Twiss function $\beta$. The generalized phase advance completely determines the spectral and structural stability properties of a general focusing lattice. For structural stability, the generalized CS theory enables application of the Krein-Moser theory to greatly simplify the stability analysis. The generalized CS theory provides an effective tool to study coupled dynamics and to discover more optimized lattice designs in the larger parameter space of general focusing lattices.},

@article{Zagorodnov2005,
abstract = {The Yee finite-difference time domain method (FDTD) is commonly used in wake field and particle-in-cell simulations. However, in accelerator modeling the high energy particles can travel in vacuum faster than their own radiation. This effect is commonly referred to as numerical Cherenkov radiation and is a consequence of numerical grid dispersion. Several numerical approaches are proposed to reduce the dispersion for all angles and for a given frequency range, that justifies itself for domains big in all three directions. On the contrary, in accelerator modeling the transverse dimensions and transverse beam velocity are small, but it is extremely important to eliminate the dispersion error in the well-defined direction of the beam motion for all frequencies. In this paper we propose a new two-level economical conservative scheme for electromagnetic field calculations in three dimensions. The scheme does not have dispersion in the longitudinal direction and is staircase-free (second order convergent). Unlike the FDTD method, it is based on a “transversal-electric/transversal-magnetic” (TE/TM)-like splitting of the field components in time. The scheme assures energy and charge conservation. Additionally, the usage of damping terms allows suppressing high frequency noise generated due to the transverse dispersion and the current fluctuations. The dispersion relation of the damping scheme is analyzed. As numerical examples show, the new scheme is much more accurate on the long-time scale than the conventional FDTD approach. },

We study this at the Cornell electron storage ring test accelerator using a 2.1 GeV low emittance beam. As the source of ions is residual gas, our measurements are conducted at various pressures, including nominal vacuum as well as injected gas (Ar, Kr). We experiment with mitigation techniques, including changing the bunch pattern to have mini-trains instead of one long train, as well as increasing the initial vertical emittance of the beam.We also check to ensure that ion-trapping is not a substantial effect in our measurements. We measure turn-by-turn vertical bunch size and position, as well as the multibunch power spectrum. Our measurements confirm fast ion instability under all vacuum conditions. A detailed simulation is then used to compare theory with observations.},

We illustrate the proposed method with an example from electromagnetic geophysics, where the scaling is often such that our logarithmic Fourier transform (LFT) should be applied. For the example chosen, we are able to obtain results that agree with those from an FFT to within 0.5 per cent in a time that is a factor of 10� shorter. Potential applications of our LFT in geophysics include conversion of wide-band electromagnetic frequency responses to transient responses, glacial loading and unloading, aquifer recharge problems, normal mode and earth tide studies in seismology, and impulsive shock wave modelling.},

In this paper, we will show how to apply the Laguerre polynomials in an analysis of this stability that are associated with the potential-well distortion. Our approach provides an alternative to the discretization method proposed by Oide and Yokoya. Moreover, it reestablishes an essential connection to the theory of mode coupling originated by Sacherer. Our new and self-consistent method is applied to study the microwave instability driven by commonly known impedances, including coherent synchrotron radiation in free space.},

We illustrate the proposed method with an example from electromagnetic geophysics, where the scaling is often such that our logarithmic Fourier transform (LFT) should be applied. For the example chosen, we are able to obtain results that agree with those from an FFT to within 0.5 per cent in a time that is a factor of 10� shorter. Potential applications of our LFT in geophysics include conversion of wide-band electromagnetic frequency responses to transient responses, glacial loading and unloading, aquifer recharge problems, normal mode and earth tide studies in seismology, and impulsive shock wave modelling.},

@phdthesis{Frasciello2016,
abstract = {The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) hosted at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research in Geneva, Switzerland, is the world's largest particle accelerator. With a circumference of 27 km, it can bring proton beams into collitions at a centre of mass energy of 14 TeV. It has been conceived and built to let scientific research to explore the high energy physics frontiers, keeping collision events at a design luminiosity of 1034 cm−2s−1. Beyond this goal challenging in itself, the High Luminosity LHC (HiLumi-LHC) project aims at increasing the LHC luminosity by an order of magnitude and one of the key ingredients to achieve that is to increase beam intensity. In order to keep beam instabilities under control and to avoid excessive power losses a careful design of new vacuum chamber components and continuous update and improvement of the LHC impedance model are required. Collimators are among the major impedance contributors. During LHC Run I, measurements with beam have revealed that the betatron coherent tune shifts were higher by about a factor of 2 with respect to the theoretical predictions based on the impedance model up to 2012. In that model the resistive wall impedance was considered as the dominating impedance contribution for collimators. By means of GdfidL electromagnetic code simulations, the geometric impedance of secondary and tertiary (TCS/TCT) collimators' real structures (i.e. not simplified) was calculated, contributing to the update of the LHC impedance model. This resulted also in a better agreement between the measured and simulated betatron tune shifts. During the LHC Long Shutdown I (LS I), some of the Run I TCS and TCT collimators were replaced by new devices, embedding Beam Position Monitor (BPM) pick-up buttons in the tapering regions, in order to provide accurate and continuous measurements of the beam centres, and ferrite blocks for the damping of the Higher Order Modes (HOMs) trapped in the collimators' structure. The injection collimators (TDI) are undergoing a substantial design review and upgrade study stage, as part of the whole LHC injection protection system upgrade foreseen to be finished in the LHC LS II (2018-2019). Measurements performed during LHC Run I have shown that the presently installed TDIs contribute significantly to both longitudinal and transverse impedance, determining beam induced heating and high vacuum pressure that affected background of experiments. In the view of higher intensities planned for the Run III and HiLumi-LHC operations, all these impedance related issues have to be minimized. The aim of this work was to perform accurate simulations of collimators' impedance, which has become very important and challenging. Accurate does mean as close as possible to the real conditions. Thus, in order to afford such a task, the huge collimators' CAD designs were used as input into GdfidL code. Besides, several dedicated tests have been performed to verify correct simulations of lossy dispersive material properties, such as resistive wall and ferrites, benchmarking code results with analytical, semi-analytical and other numerical codes outcomes. The results of the collimators wake fields and impedances calculations, together with their comparison with experimental measurements are shown and discussed.},

abstract = {The effect of finite resistance in the vacuum-tank walls on the longitudinal stability of an intense beam of particles in an accelerator is investigated theoretically. We show that even if the particle frequency is an increasing function of particle energy, the wall resistance can render the beam unstable against longitudinal bunching. In the absence of frequency spread in the unperturbed beam, the instability occurs with a growth rate that is proportional to (N /u)t, where N is the number of particles in the beam and u is the conductivity of the surface material. By means of the Vlasov equation a criterion for beam stability is obtained. In the limit of highly conducting walls the criterion involves the frequency spread in the unperturbed beam, the number of particles N, the beam energy, geometrical properties of the accelerator, but not the conductivity u. A numerical example presented indicates that certain observations of beam behavior in the MURA 40 MeV electron accelerator may be related to the phenomenon we investigated.},

abstract = {The NSLS-II storage ring is designed to operate with superconducting RF-cavities with the aim to store an average current of 500 mA distributed in 1080 bunches, with a gap in the uniform filling for ion clearing. At the early stage of the commissioning (phase 1), characterized by a bare lattice without damping wigglers and without Landau cavities, a normal conducting 7-cell PETRA-III RF-cavity structure has been installed with the goal to store an average current of 25 mA. In this paper we discuss our analysis of coupled-bunch instabilities driven by the Higher Order Modes (HOMs) of the 7-cell PETRA-III RF-cavity. As a cure of the instabilities, we apply a well-known scheme based on a proper detuning of the HOMs frequencies based upon cavity temperature change, and the use of the beneficial effect of the slow head-tail damping at positive chromaticity to increase the transverse coupled-bunch instability thresholds. In addition, we discuss measurements of coupled-bunch instabilities observed during the phase 1 commissioning of the NSLS-II storage ring. In our analysis we rely, in the longitudinal case, on the theory of coupled-bunch instability for uniform fillings, while in the transverse case we complement our studies with numerical simulations with OASIS, a novel parallel particle tracking code for self-consistent simulations of collective effects driven by short and long-range wakefields.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2016 CC-BY-3.0 and by the respective authors. The MAX IV facility includes two storage rings operated at 1.5 GeV and 3 GeV. Both rings make use of a 100 MHz RF system and are designed to operate with a uniform multibunch fill pattern aswell as employ passive harmonic cavities to damp instabilities and increase Touschek lifetime. Recently, a discussion on timing modes at the MAX IV storage rings has been initiated by the user community. This implies operating the rings with other fill patterns than the originally planned multibunch mode and therefore detailed studies of the performance of the harmonic cavities are of interest. This paper presents bunch length measurements at the 100 MHz MAX II storage ring for uniform fill patterns. The purpose of the measurements was to evaluate the employed measurement method and simulation codes for future studies of fill patterns in the MAX IV storage rings.},

As the source of ions is residual gas, our measurements are conducted at various pressures, including nominal vacuum as well as injected gas (Ar, Kr). We experiment with mitigation techniques, including changing the bunch pattern to have mini-trains instead of one long train, as well as increasing the initial vertical emittance of the beam.We also check to ensure that ion-trapping is not a substantial effect in our measurements. We measure turn-by-turn vertical bunch size and position, as well as the multibunch power spectrum. Our measurements confirm fast ion instability under all vacuum conditions. A detailed simulation is then used to compare theory with observations.},

abstract = {We present an explanation for the opposite signs of the horizontal and vertical tune shifts of bunch trains which have been observed recently in several high-energy storage rings. This result can be understood in terms of the long-range quadrupolar wakes of noncircular vacuum chambers with finite resistivity. In vacuum chambers with circular cross section, the dominant transverse wake driven by a leading particle and seen by a trailing test particle is dipolar and is proportional only to the transverse offset of the driving particle. The contributions of preceding bunches or previous turns tend to cancel, as they add with oscillatory factors. On the other hand, quadrupolar wakes are independent of the offset of the driving particle, and thus the contributions of preceding bunches and turns are strictly additive. Since quadrupole fields are focusing in one plane and defocusing in the plane orthogonal to it, their effects on tune shifts in these planes have opposite signs. Their cumulative effect also explains the large values of the tune shifts measured in PEP-II, which exceeded estimates from other impedance sources by factors of 3 to 4. Our analysis also offers a connection to the familiar Laslett tune shift.},

The algorithm is implemented in the new parallel tracking code SPACE (self-consistent parallel algorithm for collective effects) discussed in the paper. The code is applicable for accurate beam dynamics simulations in cases where both bunch-to-bunch and intrabunch motions need to be taken into account, such as chromatic head-tail effects on the coupled-bunch instability of a beam with a nonuniform filling pattern, or multibunch and single-bunch effects of a passive higher-harmonic cavity. The numerical simulations have been compared with analytical studies. For a beam with an arbitrary filling pattern, intensity-dependent complex frequency shifts have been derived starting from a system of coupled Vlasov equations. The analytical formulas and numerical simulations confirm that the analysis is reduced to the formulation of an eigenvalue problem based on the known formulas of the complex frequency shifts for the uniform filling pattern case.},

The modes of oscillation in which the bunches move rigidly are investigated; criteria for stability, and expressions for the small amplitude growth rates under unstable conditions are presented. The case of a single bunch is considered in detail and demonstrated to be stable (even in the absence of Landau damp- ing) provided p lies between an integer and the next higher half-integer, where p is the number of transverse free betatron oscillations occurring in one revolution; for many bunches which are sensibly different in intensity (a criterion for this is presented), all modes are stable provided p satisfies the same restriction. For equally spaced bunches of equal numbers of particles, approximately half the modes are unstable without Landau damping. Nu- merical examples are presented covering some intermediate situations.},

The convergence of the expansion is confirmed by computer calculation to be very rapid. The Robinson instability occurs for sharply peaked impedance. Calculation shows that a simplified approach based on the Vlasov equation can be taken when combined with an approximate stability criterion that the growth rate should be less than Imllt, where m is the azimuthal mode number and t is the radiation damping time for synchrotron oscillations. Fast instability occurs when coupling between different azimuthal modes is taken into account. The threshold of this instability calculated by the Fokker-Planck equation is almost equal to that obtained by the Vlasov equation. Thus radiation effects are shown to play little role in fast instability.},

User operation for a broad and international user community should commence in 2015. The facility is comprised of two storage rings optimized for different wavelength ranges, a linac-based short-pulse facility and a free- electron laser for the production of coherent radiation. The main radiation source of MAX IV will be a 528multralow emittance storage ring operated at 3 GeV for the generation of high-brightness hard x rays. This storage ring was designed to meet the requirements of state-of-the-art insertion devices which will be installed in nineteen 5 m long dispersion-free straight sections. The storage ring is based on a novel multibend achromat design delivering an unprecedented horizontal bare lattice emittance of 0.33 nm rad and a vertical emittance below the 8 pmrad diffraction limit for 1 A ˚ radiation. In this paper we present the beam dynamics considerations behind this storage-ring design and detail its expected unique performance.},

These vacuum chambers contribute to the impedance of the machine and to the impedance limits the single-bunch current threshold. In order to understand the contribution of the vacuum chambers and its dependence on the gap, the distribution of the vertical transverse impedance around the circumference of the APS storage ring has been determined using the response matrix fit method. This method allows us to find focusing errors around the storage ring and was originally used to determine and correct the linear model of the APS. The high accuracy of the method enables us to measure the variation of betatron phase advance around the ring with beam current. Results of these measurements are reported and the impedance of different parts of the storage ring is presented.},

abstract = {It has been known for decades that the emittance of multi-GeV storage rings can be reduced to very small values using multi-bend achromat (MBA) lattices. However, a practical design of a ring having emittance approaching the diffraction limit for multi-keV photons, i.e. a diffraction-limited storage ring (DLSR), with a circumference of order 1 km or less was not possible before the development of small-aperture vacuum systems and other accelerator technology, together with an evolution in the understanding and accurate simulation of non-linear beam dynamics, had taken place. The 3-GeV MAX IV project in Sweden has initiated a new era of MBA storage ring light source design, i.e. a fourth generation, with the Sirius project in Brazil now following suit, each having an order of magnitude smaller horizontal emittance than third-generation machines. The ESRF, APS and SPring-8 are all exploring 6-GeV MBA lattice conversions in the imminent future while China is considering a similar-energy green-field machine. Other lower-energy facilities, including the ALS, SLS, Soleil, Diamond and others, are studying the possibility of such conversions. Future larger-circumference rings, possibly housed in {\textgreater}2-km tunnels made available by decommissioned high-energy physics accelerators, could have sub-10-pm-rad emittances, providing very high coherence for {\textgreater}10-keV X-rays.

abstract = {The resistive wall impedance of cylindrical vacuum chambers was first calculated over 40 years ago. The original results were valid for metal vacuum chamber walls which are thick compared to the skin depth at the frequencies of interest. Recently the subject has again become important for beam stability in the LHC where in particular the transverse impedance of the large number of graphite collimators to be installed could severely limit its performance, if the “thick wall” formulae were correct. The frequencies of the slow betatron waves in such a large machine are very low and thus the transverse impedance, originally found to be proportional to the inverse square root of frequency, could lead to instabilities. However, when the skin depth exceeds the wall thickness, the transverse resistive wall impedance is strongly reduced and a number of papers have recently been published to estimate this reduction. However, all of these had restrictions of validity. Here we give a consistent derivation of the general expression for the transverse impedance of walls made of arbitrary materials which are valid at all frequencies. The results are compared with previous ones in the graphs for the LHC collimators - where they agree quite well, but also for the SPS-MKE kickers which are required for injection into the LHC and where the agreement is less perfect.},

abstract = {An analytical expression of the low-frequency quadrupole impedance for undulators and wigglers is derived and benchmarked against beam-based impedance measurements done at the 3 GeV NSLS-II storage ring. The adopted theoretical model, valid for an arbitrary number of electromagnetic layers with parallel geometry, allows to calculate the quadrupole impedance for arbitrary values of the magnetic permeability $\mu$r. In the comparison of the analytical results with the measurements for variable magnet gaps, two limit cases of the permeability have been studied: the case of perfect magnets ($\mu$r → ∞), and the case in which the magnets are fully saturated ($\mu$r = 1).},

abstract = {The main contribution into the total impedance of the VEPP-4M is made by places of non-uniformity of vacuum chamber, such as sharp change of cross section, ceramic inserts, vertical electrostatic separators and by HOMs of cavities. Computer code GdfidL is used for the estimate of impedances in some of above structures. A new method for measurement of transverse coupling impedance has been used. The method is based on measuring of closed orbit deviation caused by localized impedance. Transverse impedance acts on the beam as a defocusing quadrupole, strength of which depends on the beam current. If a local bump of closed orbit has been created at the impedance location, then the orbit deviation occurs while varying the beam current. The local impedance can be evaluated using the orbit deviation measured. The results of the measurements and numerical calculations are presented and compared.},

Definitions, general theorems, modal analysis, diffraction model, and analytical results comprise the content of the paper. Several new results are included. In particular, necessary and sufficient conditions for the independence of the impedance on the beam longitudinal direc- tion are given. The impedances of two basic simple structures — that of a cavity and that of a step — are studied in detail. The transition from the regime of a cavity to the regime of a step is explained, an ap- proximate formula describing this transition is given, and the criterion for determining the applicability of each regime is established. The asymptotic behavior of the impedance for a finite number Mof periodical- ly arranged cavities as a function ofM is studied. The difference in the behavior of the impedance for a single cavity and that for an infinite number of cavities is explained as the result of the interference of the diffracted waves. A criterion for determining the transition in the impedance behavior from small M to large Mis presented.},

Since instabilities occur during in- jection, when the passive harmonic cavity potential is also time varying, it became important to simulate this transient process. The most promising approach was considered to be multibunch tracking which also allows for an arbitrary ?lling pattern. Since every bunch is represented by nu- merous macro-particles, internalmotions as well as micro- structures in the charge distribution can be followed.},

In other words, the wake fields do not leak out of the insert unless it is extremely thin.},

abstract = {The fifth CERN Accelerator School (CAS) advanced course on Accelerator Physics was given at the paradise Hotel, Rhodes, Greece from 20 September to 1 October 1993. Its syllabus was based on the previous similar courses held at oxford 1985, Berlin 1987, Uppsala 1989 and Noordwijkerhout 1991, and whose proceedings were published as CERN Reports 87-03, 89-01, 90-04, respectively. The present volumes are intended to replace and to bring up to date all the material in earlier publications. They contain not only all the lectures given in the Rhodes course but a number of important contribution to previous courses which ar thought to be essential for a complete understanding of all aspects of the disign and construction of particle accelerators at an advanced level. They include sections on Hamiltonian equations and accelerator optics, chromaticity and dynamic beam aperture, paricle tracking, the kinetic theory, longitudinal beam optics, coherent instabilitis, beam-beam dynamics, intra-beam scattering, beam cooling, Schottki noise, beam radiation, neutralisation, beam polarisation, radio-frequency quadrupoles, as well as chapters on space charge, superconducting magnets, crystal bending, beam-beam measurement and accelerator medical applications.},

abstract = {A method is presented for determining the stability of a system consisting of several highly relativistic bunches of charged particles circulating in a storage ring. The particles interact with magnets designed to guide the beam as well as with electromagnetic fields induced by the particles themselves. Previous work has considered modes where all bunches in the ring are executing the same type of internal oscillation. This dissertation considers the results of allowing those modes to couple to one another. The formalism begins with a self- consistent distribution, and analyzes small perturbations to that distribution to determine if they grow exponentially. The formalism allows one to do this computation for an arbitrary magnetic lattice, as well as an arbitrary distribution of wakefield sources around the ring. The method also allows for the inclusion of a feedback system which is designed to damp multibunch oscillations. The PEP-II B-factory with a linear lattice is used as an example to demonstrate and explain the phenomenology that results from this coupling of multibunch modes. The effect of adding feedback is also explored.},

@phdthesis{Mounet2012,
abstract = {In this thesis, the problemof the transverse coupled-bunch instabilities created by the LargeHadron Collider (LHC) beam-coupling impedance, that can possibly limit the machine operation, is addressed thanks to several new theories and tools. A rather complete vision of the problemis proposed here, going fromthe calculation of the impedances and wake functions of individual machine elements, to the beam dynamics study. Firstly, new results are obtained in the theory of the beam-coupling impedance for an axisymmetric two-dimensional structure, generalizing Zotter's theories, and a new general theory is derived for the impedance of an infinite flat two-dimensional structure. Then, a new approach has been found to compute thewake functions fromsuch analytically obtained beam-coupling impedances, over- coming limitations that could be met with standard discrete Fourier transformprocedures. Those results are then used to obtain an impedance andwake function model of the LHC, based on the (resistive-) wall impedances of various contributors (collimators, beamscreens and vacuumpipe) and additional estimations of the geometrical impedance contributions. Finally, the existing code HEADTAIL,which is a macroparticle simulation code for beam dynamics studies with wake fields, is improved to make possible the simulation ofmultibunch trains, and a spectral analysis technique is found to facilitate the analysis of the output given by this code, giving the complex tune shifts of the unstable modes present in a simulation. All those theories and tools are used to obtain new results concerning the LHC transverse coupled-bunch instabilities, demonstrating the rather small impact on coupled-bunch instabilities of the number of bunches in a train when the bunch spacing is fixed, and the existence of coupled-bunch modes with intrabunch motion which are more critical than their single-bunch counterparts. A full verification of the complete procedure (impedance theories, impedance model and simulation code) is also performed by comparing the simulation results with actualmeasurements in the LHC, giving a very good agreement at injection energy and a correct order ofmagnitude at 3.5 TeV/c. In the end, several predictions concerning the beam stability at the future 7 TeV/c operation of the machine are performed in the case of 50 ns spacing (1404 bunches), revealing that the coupled-bunch transverse mode coupling instability threshold is far above the ultimate bunch intensity but about 20{\%} smaller than its single-bunch counterpart. Stability studies with Landau octupoles at their maximumcurrents reveal that the beam remains stable at nominal intensity withQ? =2 in both planes, provided the particle transverse distributions are Gaussian. At ultimate intensity with eitherQ? =0 orQ? =2, or at nominal intensitywhen the chromaticity is zero, the beam happens to be unstable, even with the octupoles at theirmaximumcurrents.},

Transverse impedance acts on the beam as a defocusing quadrupole, strength of which depends on the beam current. If a local bump of closed orbit has been created at the impedance location, then the orbit deviation occurs while varying the beam current. The local impedance can be evaluated using the orbit deviation measured. Measurement technique is described, the method accuracy is evaluated.

Transient beam loading in the harmonic cavities generated by asym- metries in the fill pattern causes significant variation of the bunch synchronous phase and bunch length along the bunch train when the longitudinal restoring force has been reduced. This results in a significant reduction in the mean bunch lengthening and potential lifetime increase. We describe how beam current modulations give rise to transient effects much larger than expected from the linear model of the beam cavity interaction. We also develop a tracking simulation to predict results and apply this simulation to an analysis of the beam loading transients for the case of passive and active normal and superconducting third harmonic rf systems using Advanced Light Source parameters.},

abstract = {The RF system for the Pohang Light Source (PLS) storage ring was greatly upgraded for PLS-II project of 3.0GeV/400mA from 2.5GeV/200mA. The point of big upgrade is to adopt superconducting RF (SRF) cavities and digital low level RF (LLRF). The RF system is under operation with five normal conducting (NC) cavities for beam current of 100mA to provide user beams from March 2012 with two 300kW klystron and two 75kW klystron amplifiers [phase-I]. Two SRF cryomodules with cryogenic system are installed and testing during summer shutdown period in 2012 because of long delivery [phase- II]. And then user beam will be serviced with SRF system from 2013. The third SRF cavity installation plan in 2014 is also in preparation to increase the storage ring current up to 400mA with all 20 insertion devices [phase- III]. This paper describes the present installation, commissioning, operation status, upgrade progress and future plan of the RF system for the upgrade project of PLS-II storage ring.},

@techreport{Bane1991,
abstract = {-- In this paper we find the short range resistive wall wakefields of a point particle in a cylindrical tube, both for a dc model of conductivity and for an ac model. The distance scale SO depends on the radius of the tube and on the conductivity of the metal walls, and in typical structures is on the order of tens of microns. For both ac and dc models the short range wakefield is found to be well approximated by a simple, high frequency resonator wakefield. For the dc model of conductivity the frequency of the resonance is given by w/c = fi/ so and the Q-factor equals a/2. We provide a physical model to explain these results. For the ac model of conduc- tivity the resonance frequency depends also on the relaxation time of the metal 7. For large cr/so the frequency becomes w/c = dm, with oP the plasma frequency of the metal and b the tube radius, and the Q-factor becomes large. Finally we obtain the wakefields of a short Gaussian bunch, and then calculate the loss factor. From our results we find that, even for short bunches, the loss factor for the ac model is only slightly larger than that for the dc model.},

abstract = {Injection into the two MAX IV storage rings will not make use of a 4-kicker local injection bump. Instead, pulsed multipole injection will be used for initial filling as well as top-up injection. Since commissioning a pulsed multipole magnet for injection into a storage ring is non-trivial, it has been decided to install a single dipole kicker magnet into the storage rings to provide a simple method for injection during early commissioning. Design studies have revealed that injection with a single dipole kicker into the MAX IV storage rings is not only efficient, but also allows for accumulation of beam. Although this accumulation cannot be made transparent to users (i.e. it is not compatible with user top-up operation), it does provide a simple and robust injection method during commissioning. In addition, the dipole kicker can be used as a pinger magnet during machine studies with a single-bunch filling. This paper reports on the design studies performed for dipole kicker injection into the MAX IV storage rings and presents a summary of the expected performance of such an injection scheme. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The coupling impedance of beam tubes is a long-standing important topic for particle accelerators that many authors have addressed. The present study was initiated in view of a specific problem, but its novel approach is broadly applicable to the longitudinal and transverse coupling impedances of coated beam tubes or multilayer tubes. The matrix method presented here derives the wall impedance by treating the radial wave propagation of the beam-excited electromagnetic fields in full analogy to longitudinal transmission lines. Starting from the Maxwell equations, the radially transverse magnetic field compo- nents are described for monopole and dipole modes by a 22 matrix. Assuming isotropic material properties within one layer, the transverse field components at the inner boundary of a layer uniquely are determined by matrix transfer of the field components at its outer boundary. By imposing power-flow constraints on the matrix, wave impedance mapping and field matching between layers is enforced and replaced by matrix multiplication. The longitudinal and transverse coupling impedances are derived from the wall impedance at the innermost boundary, and the different procedures for its determination are discussed. The matrix method is demonstrated via selected yet representative examples of the well-documented cases of a stainless-steel tube, and of a graphite collimator.},

abstract = {A Tensor equation has been used to derive the equations of motion for the curvilinear coordinate system customarily used for particle accelerators. A Hamiltonian formalism, expanded to third order in the canonical variables, has also been developed to describe the transverse motion in an accelerator. Time-dependent perturbation theory has been applied and computerized using a computer-algebra system. In particular, the perturbations due to magnetic sextupoles have been calculated to second power in the sextupole strength. The frequency spectra for the horizontal and the vertical betatron motion close to a single resonance have been calculated using time-independent perturbation theory. It has been shown that information about excited resonances and the type of driving field can be derived from the spectra. In particular, it is possible to obtain the amplitude and the phase of a given resonance. The results have been used to study the perturbations in the Low Energy Antiproton Ring (LEAR) at CERN.},

abstract = {The installation of a second RF cavity in the UVX elec- tron storage ring at the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Lab- oratory (LNLS) at the end of 2003 brought about lon- gitudinal instabilities driven by one of the HOMs of the new cavity. Even though the operational difficulties re- lated to these unstable modes were successfully overcome by means of a combination of cavity tuning (using temper- ature and plunger adjustments) with phase modulation of the RF fields at the second harmonic of the synchrotron fre- quency, a more appropriate technique to avoid those prob- lems is the use of higher harmonic cavities, which have the important advantage of providing damping of the longitu- dinal modes without increasing the energy spread. In this work we present the design of a passive higher harmonic cavity (HHC) system optimized for operation at the LNLS storage ring. The parameters for a set of cavities as well as the analysis of some of the effects that they may introduce in the beam dynamics are presented.},

@article{Chin2016,
abstract = {In this paper, we present a new two particle model for studying the strong head-tail instabilities in the presence of the space-charge force. It is a simple expansion of the well-known two particle model for strong head-tail instability and is still analytically solvable. No chromaticity effect is included. It leads to a formula for the growth rate as a function of the two dimensionless parameters: the space-charge tune shift parameter (normalized by the synchrotron tune) and the wakefield strength, ϒ. The three-dimensional contour plot of the growth rate as a function of those two dimensionless parameters reveals stopband structures. Many simulation results generally indicate that a strong head-tail instability can be damped by a weak space- charge force, but the beam becomes unstable again when the space-charge force is further increased. The newtwo particle model indicates a similar behavior. In weak space-charge regions, additional tune shifts by the space-charge force dissolve the mode coupling. As the space-charge force is increased, they conversely restore the mode coupling, but then a further increase of the space-charge force decouples the modes again. This mode coupling/decoupling behavior creates the stopband structures.},

@article{Cullinan2016,
abstract = {A small vacuum chamber aperture is a present trend in the design of future synchrotron light sources. This leads to a large resistive-wall impedance that can drive coupled-bunch instabilities. Another trend is the use of passively driven cavities at a harmonic of the main radio frequency to lengthen the electron bunches in order to increase the Touschek lifetime and reduce emittance blowup due to intrabeam scattering. In some cases, the harmonic cavities may be tuned to fulfill the flat potential condition.With this condition met, it has been predicted in simulation that the threshold current for coupled-bunch resistive- wall instabilities is much higher than with no bunch lengthening at all. In this paper, the features of a bunch in the flat potential that would contribute toward this stabilization are identified and discussed. The threshold currents for these instabilities are estimated for the MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring at different values of chromaticity using macroparticle simulations in the time domain and, within the limits of the existing theory, frequency domain calculations. By comparing the results from these two methods and analyzing the spectra of the dominant head-tail modes, the impact of each of the distinguishing features of a bunch in the flat potential can be explained and quantified in terms of the change in threshold current. It is found that, above a certain chromaticity, the threshold current is determined by the radial structure of the zeroth-order head-tail mode. This happens at a lower chromaticity if the bunch length is longer.},

Besides the features that stem from [3] – perfect reconstruction and computational efficiency – we propose here a technique for computing coefficient phases in a way that makes their interpretation more natural.

Re- cently, a discussion on timing modes at theMAXIV storage rings has been initiated by the user community. This implies operating the rings with other fill patterns than the originally planned multibunch mode and therefore detailed studies of the performance of the harmonic cavities are of interest. This paper presents bunch length measurements at the 100 MHz MAX II storage ring for uniform fill patterns.

abstract = {The transverse electromagnetic interaction of an intense azimuthally uniform beam of particles with itself, including the effect of a resistive vacuum tank, is investigated theoretically. It is shown that a beam of particles all having velocity v is unstable against the development of transverse waves having a phase velocity close to (1-v/n)v, where v is the number of transverse free betatron oscillations occurring in one revolution and n is a positive integer greater than v. The growth rate for the instability is proportional to N jut, where N is the number of particles in the beam and u is the conductivity of the surface material of the vacuum tank. Stabilizing mechanisms are examined by means of the Vlasov equatIon and it is shown that a spread in the quantity (n-v)v, evaluated for particles in the unperturbed beam, will prevent the instability. A criterion for the spread required is shown, in the limit of walls at high conductivity, to depend upon the beam intensity and energy as well as upon certain geometrical properties of the accelerator, but not upon the conductivity. Numerical examples covering a range of particle accelerators are presented, and suggest that the theory is in agreement with the coherent beam behavior recently observed in a number of accelerators.},

The latter include beam-induced machine heating, Touschek scattering, intra-beam scattering, as well as incoherent tune shifts. The general trend that the efforts to achieve ultra-low emittance result in increasing the machine coupling impedance and the beam sensitivity to instability is reviewed. The nature of coupling impedance in a DLSR is described, followed by a series of potentially dangerous beam instabilities driven by the former, such as resistive-wall, TMCI (transverse mode coupling instability), head{\{}--{\}}tail and microwave instabilities. In addition, beam-ion and CSR (coherent synchrotron radiation) instabilities are also treated. Means to fight against collective effects such as lengthening of the bunch with passive harmonic cavities and bunch-by-bunch transverse feedback are introduced. Numerical codes developed and used to evaluate the machine coupling impedance, as well as to simulate beam instability using the former as inputs are described.},

Several other projects are in the design stage and these will probably enhance the performance further.

The quality of new science will be limited by the weakest component in this value chain. Breakthroughs can be expected in high-resolution imaging, microscopy and spectroscopy.

In contrast to such tubes, however, the gain is affected very little by appreciable changes in the circuit parameters or operating voltage; furthermore, self-oscillation is inherently absent because the input is effectively isolated from the output. Experiments are described that were performed mainly to verify the theory; the existence of the growing wave was demonstrated, and the measured gain was in good agreement with the theory.},

The present volumes are intended to replace and to bring up to date all the material in earlier publications. They contain not only all the lectures given in the Rhodes course but a number of important contribution to previous courses which ar thought to be essential for a complete understanding of all aspects of the disign and construction of particle accelerators at an advanced level. They include sections on Hamiltonian equations and accelerator optics, chromaticity and dynamic beam aperture, paricle tracking, the kinetic theory, longitudinal beam optics, coherent instabilitis, beam-beam dynamics, intra-beam scattering, beam cooling, Schottki noise, beam radiation, neutralisation, beam polarisation, radio-frequency quadrupoles, as well as chapters on space charge, superconducting magnets, crystal bending, beam-beam measurement and accelerator medical applications.},

@phdthesis{Rimjaem2006,
abstract = {this thesis is to design and optimize the RF-gun to achieve electron bunch length in femtosecond scale. Starting from the Stanford SUNSHINE design, the RF-gun has been optimized and constructed. These studies were performed by numerical simulation using the codes SUPERFISH and PARMELA. Systematic simulation studies were carried out to investigate the fundamental and practical limits in reducing the electron bunch length. The numerical studies include bunch length dispersion due to focusing in the transport system leading to a final bunch length of some 53 fs with a bunch charge of 94 pCb giving a peak current of 707 A. The RF-gun was constructed based on simulation results. Low-power RF measurements were performed and the results shows that the resonant frequency of the RF-gun is 2855.3 MHz at 25oC in ambient air, which can be tuned to 2856 MHz by adjusting the RF-gun temperature, and the quality factor is 12979 with the RF-coupling coefficient of about 7.5. The RF-gun and other components have been installed at the SURIYA project. The experimental results show that the electron beam of 2-2.5 MeV maximum kinetic energy and a beam current up to 1 A can be obtained from the RF-gun with input power of 3.65 MW. Electron bunches as short as 53 fs can be converted into broad band co- herent radiation in the high-intensity far-infrared (FIR) regime at wavelengths of 50-1000 µm. To verify the simulation results, a transition radiation experimental station to produce FIR transition radiation has been installed. Recently, the FIR signal from transition radiation was successfully observed and verified for the first time at SURIYA laboratory by using room temperature pyroelectric detector.},

The theory is shown to agree fairly well with the computer simulation for PETRA and some numerical examples are given for the booster of the TRIUMF Kaon Factory project.

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the electromagnetic interaction between a point charge travelling inside a waveguide of elliptical cross section, and the waveguide itself. By using a convenient expansion of the Mathieu functions, useful in particular for treating a variety of problems in applied mathematics and physics with elliptic geometry, we first obtain the longitudinal electromagnetic field of a point charge (Green's function) in free space in terms of elliptical coordinates. This expression allows, then, to calculate the scattered field due to the boundary conditions in our geometry. By summing the contribution of the direct or primary field and the indirect field scattered by the boundary, after a careful choice of some expansion expressions, we derive a novel formula of the longitudinal electric field, in any transverse position of the elliptical cross section, generated by the charge moving along the longitudinal axis of the waveguide. The obtained expression is represented in a closed form, it can be differentiated and integrated, it can be used to fully describe the radiation process of a particle beam travelling inside a waveguide of elliptical cross section, and it is valid for any elliptic geometry. The equations are used to evaluate the coupling impedance due to indirect space charge in case of elliptical geometry. In addition, they are useful as preliminary studies for the determination of the coupling impedance in different cases involving elliptic vacuum chambers, as, for example, the effect of the finite conductivity of the beam pipe wall or the geometrical variation of the vacuum chamber due to elliptic step transitions existing in some accelerators.},

abstract = {A specific feature of ferrites is that these materials behave either as metals or magneto- dielectrics, depending on the frequency range. Their magnetic permeability is a function of frequency as well. In this paper, the transverse impedance of a ferrite kicker is calculated. The method suggested in Ref. [1] is generalized here for ferrites. Namely, in [1] it is assumed that the electric field of the beam charge dipole is always perfectly shielded. In fact, this assumption requires the conductivity being high compared with the frequency. This is not necessarily true for the high frequencies of a proton single-bunch spectrum. That is why the dynamics of the electric shielding has to be taken into account for ferrite kickers. The generalized analytic result is applied for the ferrite MKE kickers at the CERN SPS, and a fairly},

Computer code GdfidL is used for the estimate of impedances in some of above structures. A new method for measurement of transverse coupling impedance has been used. The method is based on measuring of closed orbit deviation caused by localized impedance. Transverse impedance acts on the beam as a defocusing quadrupole, strength of which depends on the beam current. If a local bump of closed orbit has been created at the impedance location, then the orbit deviation occurs while varying the beam current. The local impedance can be evaluated using the orbit deviation measured. The results of the measurements and numerical calculations are presented and compared.},

Few sources of such FIR radiation currently exist. Superradiant undulator radiation produced at the SUNSHINE (Stanford UNiversity SHort INtense Electron-source) is such a FIR source. First proposed in the mm-wave spectral range by Motz, superradiant undulator radiation has been realized in the 45 um to 300 um spectral range by using sub-picosecond electron bunches produced by the SUNSHINE facility. The experimental setup and measurements of this FIR radiation are reported in this thesis. In addition to being a useful FIR source, the superradiant undulator radiation produced at SUNSHINE is an object of research in itself. Measured superlinear growth of the radiated energy along the undulator demonstrates the self-amplification of radiation by the electron bunch. This superlinear growth is seen at 47 um to 70 um wavelengths. These wavelengths are an order of magnitude shorter than in previous self-amplification demonstrations.},

This paper describes a method, which is the generalization of Sacherer's theory without mode couplings, to analyze the fast transverse instability in a Gaussian bunch. This method includes the radial modes and requires negative azimuthal modes. It makes clear that the fast instability in PEP and PETRA is caused by the mode coupling between the azimuthal modes m = 0 and m = -1, and that its growth rate rises very rapidly above the threshold. The method also predicts that the threshold current could not be improved by a large factor even if the bunch length is increased to several centimeters. The TRISTAN threshold current estimated by scaling from the PEP experimental data is about 3.5 mA per bunch for the worst case. ?? 1983.},

abstract = {The MAX IV storage rings, currently under construction in Lund, Sweden, will use third harmonic cavities operated passively to lengthen the bunches and alleviate collective instabilities. These cavities are an essential ingredient in the MAX IV design concept and are required for achieving the final design goals in terms of stored current, beam emittance, and beam lifetime—such performance challenges are in fact common to all recent ultralow emittance storage ring designs and harmonic cavities are currently under consideration in several laboratories. In this paper, we report on parametric studies comparing different harmonic cavity settings in terms of the resulting bunch length, peak bunch density, and incoherent synchrotron frequency spread for the MAX IV 3 GeV ring. The equilibrium longitudinal bunch density distribution was calculated by establishing a self-consistent equation for the bunch form factor, describing the bunch shape. The calculations are fully self-consistent in the sense that not only the amplitude but also the phase of the waves excited by the beam in the harmonic cavity were assumed to be a function of the bunch shape, which allowed us to explore a wide parameter range not restricted to the region close to the conditions for which the first and second derivatives of the total rf voltage are zero at the synchronous phase. Our results indicate that up to a factor 5 increase in rms bunch length is achievable with a purely passive system for theMAXIV 3 GeV ring while keeping a relatively large harmonic cavity detuning, thus limiting the unavoidable Robinson antidamping rate from the fundamental mode of a passively operated harmonic cavity to values below the synchrotron radiation damping rate. The paper is complemented by results of measurements performed in the MAX III storage ring, which showed good agreement with calculations following the fully self-consistent approach.},

The theory is applied to LEP at injection with third higher-harmonic cavities, and the results were compared with those obtained by the multi-particle simulation program.

A positron or proton bunch passing through this ‘‘electron cloud'' experiences a force similar to a short-range wake field. This effective wake field can cause a transverse-mode-coupling instability, if the electron-cloud density exceeds a threshold value. In this report, we compute the electron-cloud induced wake in a region without external magnetic field both analytically and via computer simulation, for parameters representing the low-energy positron ring of KEKB and the LHC proton beam in the CERN SPS. We study the linearity and time dependence of the wake function and its variation with the size of the electron cloud. Using a broadband resonator model for the electron-cloud wake field, we then evaluate theoretical expressions for the transverse- mode-coupling instability based on the linearized Vlasov equation, and for the instability threshold of fast transverse blow up including its dependence on chromaticity.},

Two theoretical models, which both take into account the field diffusion across chamber walls of finite thickness, are employed to compare the measurement with theoretical expectations. Specific experimental methods, based respectively upon orbit analysis, bunch-by-bunch transverse feedback and a single particle betatron resonance, are introduced to measure the incoherent focusing effect in the three regimes. It is found that the excited incoherent fields can be large enough to affect the ring performance. The non-negligible contribution of nonevaporable getter coating is shown to improve the agreement between measurements and calculations.},

abstract = {The ionization of residual gas by an electron beam in an accelerator generates ions that can resonantly couple to the beam through a wave propagating in the beam-ion system. A beam-ion instability is studied for a multibunch train, taking into account the decoherence of ien oscillations due to the ion frequency spread. It is shown that while the decoherence does not completely suppress the instability, it makes the growth rate smaller. A comparison of analytical and numerical results indicates good agreement with direct macroparticle simulation of the instability.},

abstract = {High-power, pulsed, coherent, far-infrared (FIR) radiation has many scientific applications, such as pump-probe studies of surfaces, liquids, and solids, studies of high-Tc, superconductors, biophysics, plasma diagnostics, and excitation of Rydberg atoms. Few sources of such FIR radiation currently exist. Superradiant undulator radiation produced at the SUNSHINE (Stanford UNiversity SHort INtense Electron-source) is such a FIR source. First proposed in the mm-wave spectral range by Motz, superradiant undulator radiation has been realized in the 45 um to 300 um spectral range by using sub-picosecond electron bunches produced by the SUNSHINE facility. The experimental setup and measurements of this FIR radiation are reported in this thesis. In addition to being a useful FIR source, the superradiant undulator radiation produced at SUNSHINE is an object of research in itself. Measured superlinear growth of the radiated energy along the undulator demonstrates the self-amplification of radiation by the electron bunch. This superlinear growth is seen at 47 um to 70 um wavelengths. These wavelengths are an order of magnitude shorter than in previous self-amplification demonstrations.},

abstract = {The Advanced Photon Source storage ring has a number of narrow-gap insertion device vacuum chambers, and there is a plan to further increase their number. These vacuum chambers contribute to the impedance of the machine and to the impedance limits the single-bunch current threshold. In order to understand the contribution of the vacuum chambers and its dependence on the gap, the distribution of the vertical transverse impedance around the circumference of the APS storage ring has been determined using the response matrix fit method. This method allows us to find focusing errors around the storage ring and was originally used to determine and correct the linear model of the APS. The high accuracy of the method enables us to measure the variation of betatron phase advance around the ring with beam current. Results of these measurements are reported and the impedance of different parts of the storage ring is presented.},

abstract = {We present the multibunch tracking code mbtrack developed to simulate, in 6-dimensional phase space, single- and multibunch collective instabilities driven by short- and long-range wakefields in storage rings. Multiple bunches, each composed of a large number of macroparticles, are tracked, allowing simulation of both intra- and interbunch motions. Besides analytical impedance models, the code allows employment of numerical wake potentials computed with electromagnetic (EM) field solvers. The corresponding impedances are fitted to a number of known analytical functions and the coefficients obtained in the fit are used as an input to the code. mbtrack performs a dynamic treatment of long-range resistive-wall and harmonic cavity fields, which are likely to be the two major factors impacting multibunch collective motions in many present and future ring-based light sources. Furthermore, it is capable of simulating beam-ion interactions as well as transverse bunch-by-bunch feedback. We describe the physical effects considered in the code and their implementation, which makes use of parallel processing to significantly shorten the computation time. mbtrack is benchmarked against other codes and applied to the MAX IV 3GeV ring as an example, where the importance of the interplay of various physical effects as well as coupling among different degrees of freedom is demonstrated.},

abstract = {In this paper we discuss representations of charge particle densities in particle-in-cell simulations, analyze the sources and profiles of the intrinsic numerical noise, and present efficient methods for their removal. We devise two alternative estimation methods for charged particle distribution which represent significant improvement over the Monte Carlo cosine expansion used in the 2D code of Bassi et al., designed to simulate coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) in charged particle beams. The improvement is achieved by employing an alternative beam density estimation to the Monte Carlo cosine expansion. The representation is first binned onto a finite grid, after which two grid-based methods are employed to approximate particle distributions: (i) truncated fast cosine transform; and (ii) thresholded wavelet transform (TWT). We demonstrate that these alternative methods represent a staggering upgrade over the original Monte Carlo cosine expansion in terms of efficiency, while the TWT approximation also provides an appreciable improvement in accuracy. The improvement in accuracy comes from a judicious removal of the numerical noise enabled by the wavelet formulation. The TWT method is then integrated into the CSR code, and benchmarked against the original version. We show that the new density estimation method provides a superior performance in terms of efficiency and spatial resolution, thus enabling high-fidelity simulations of CSR effects, including microbunching instability. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

However , to fully explore the potential of these new sources, it is necessary to optimize other vari ables as well, such as the proper matching of electrons and photons phase - space and the possibility of using new kinds of insertion devices. Equally important is to try new ways to improve the integration between the light s ource capabilities and the experiment needs.

abstract = {this thesis is to design and optimize the RF-gun to achieve electron bunch length in femtosecond scale. Starting from the Stanford SUNSHINE design, the RF-gun has been optimized and constructed. These studies were performed by numerical simulation using the codes SUPERFISH and PARMELA. Systematic simulation studies were carried out to investigate the fundamental and practical limits in reducing the electron bunch length. The numerical studies include bunch length dispersion due to focusing in the transport system leading to a final bunch length of some 53 fs with a bunch charge of 94 pCb giving a peak current of 707 A. The RF-gun was constructed based on simulation results. Low-power RF measurements were performed and the results shows that the resonant frequency of the RF-gun is 2855.3 MHz at 25oC in ambient air, which can be tuned to 2856 MHz by adjusting the RF-gun temperature, and the quality factor is 12979 with the RF-coupling coefficient of about 7.5. The RF-gun and other components have been installed at the SURIYA project. The experimental results show that the electron beam of 2-2.5 MeV maximum kinetic energy and a beam current up to 1 A can be obtained from the RF-gun with input power of 3.65 MW. Electron bunches as short as 53 fs can be converted into broad band co- herent radiation in the high-intensity far-infrared (FIR) regime at wavelengths of 50-1000 µm. To verify the simulation results, a transition radiation experimental station to produce FIR transition radiation has been installed. Recently, the FIR signal from transition radiation was successfully observed and verified for the first time at SURIYA laboratory by using room temperature pyroelectric detector.},

@phdthesis{Berg1996,
abstract = {A method is presented for determining the stability of a system consisting of several highly relativistic bunches of charged particles circulating in a storage ring. The particles interact with magnets designed to guide the beam as well as with electromagnetic fields induced by the particles themselves. Previous work has considered modes where all bunches in the ring are executing the same type of internal oscillation. This dissertation considers the results of allowing those modes to couple to one another. The formalism begins with a self- consistent distribution, and analyzes small perturbations to that distribution to determine if they grow exponentially. The formalism allows one to do this computation for an arbitrary magnetic lattice, as well as an arbitrary distribution of wakefield sources around the ring. The method also allows for the inclusion of a feedback system which is designed to damp multibunch oscillations. The PEP-II B-factory with a linear lattice is used as an example to demonstrate and explain the phenomenology that results from this coupling of multibunch modes. The effect of adding feedback is also explored.},

@article{Smaluk2012,
abstract = {Transverse head-tail instability is a severe limitation of a single-bunch beam current in circular accelerators. Applicability and efficiency of feedbacks for suppression of the instability is analyzed. Both chromatic and nonlinear effects have been taken into account to understand the processes of excitation and damping of the instability. Analytical estimations are compared with the results of experiments and numerical simulations. A feedback system has been developed, installed and commissioned at the VEPP-4M electron-positron collider. An original scheme of the kicker powering has been developed to provide the necessary performance with minimal expenses. Real-time digital data processing performed by a code running in an FPGA module provides high efficiency and flexibility of the system. During the system commissioning, a more than threefold increase of intensity of the VEPP-4M single-bunch beam has been achieved. {\textcopyright} 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.},
