abstract = {Two dimensional electromagnetic models (i.e. assuming an infinite length) for the vacuum chamber elements in a synchrotron are often quite useful to give a first estimate of the total beam-coupling impedance. In these models, classical approximations can fail under certain conditions of frequency or material properties. We present here two formalisms for flat and cylindrical geometries, enabling the computation of fields and impedances in the multilayer case without any assumption on the frequency, beam ve- locity or material properties (except linearity, isotropy and homogeneity).},

abstract = {High-power, pulsed, coherent, far-infrared (FIR) radiation has many scientific applications, such as pump-probe studies of surfaces, liquids, and solids, studies of high-Tc, superconductors, biophysics, plasma diagnostics, and excitation of Rydberg atoms. Few sources of such FIR radiation currently exist. Superradiant undulator radiation produced at the SUNSHINE (Stanford UNiversity SHort INtense Electron-source) is such a FIR source. First proposed in the mm-wave spectral range by Motz, superradiant undulator radiation has been realized in the 45 um to 300 um spectral range by using sub-picosecond electron bunches produced by the SUNSHINE facility. The experimental setup and measurements of this FIR radiation are reported in this thesis. In addition to being a useful FIR source, the superradiant undulator radiation produced at SUNSHINE is an object of research in itself. Measured superlinear growth of the radiated energy along the undulator demonstrates the self-amplification of radiation by the electron bunch. This superlinear growth is seen at 47 um to 70 um wavelengths. These wavelengths are an order of magnitude shorter than in previous self-amplification demonstrations.},

Outcomes from this study are a novel and efficient matrix method for the field matching determination of all the constants involved in the field components, and the generalization to any azimuthal mode together with the final summation on all such modes in the impedance formulas. In particular the multimode direct space-charge impedances (both longitudinal and transverse) are given, as well as the wall impedance to any order of precision. New quadrupolar terms for the transverse wall impedance are found, which look negligible in the ultrarelativistic case but might be of significance for low-energy beams. In principle from this analysis the electromagnetic fields created by any particular source, with a finite transverse shape, can then be computed using convolutions.},

Such muhi-bunch or multi-turn instabilities due to long range forces can be described by the cavity mode frequencies and field patterns. For structures of cylindrical symmetry a computer code named URMEL is described which calculates resonant modes of any azimuthal mode number m = 0, 1, 2... (monopole, dipole, quadrupole, etc.). The eigenfrequencies are found as linear eigenvahies of a large matrix and simple mathematical procedures guarantee that no modes are missed. The combined use of URMEL in the frequency domain and of the complementary code TBCI in the time domain enables a complete analysis of long range - low frequency - forces (narrow band impedances) and short range - high frequency - forces (broad band impedances).

@article{Al-Dmour2014,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Some of the characteristics of recent ultralow-emittance storage-ring designs and possibly future diffraction-limited storage rings are a compact lattice combined with small magnet apertures. Such requirements present a challenge for the design and performance of the vacuum system. The vacuum system should provide the required vacuum pressure for machine operation and be able to handle the heat load from synchrotron radiation. Small magnet apertures result in the conductance of the chamber being low, and lumped pumps are ineffective. One way to provide the required vacuum level is by distributed pumping, which can be realised by the use of a non-evaporable getter (NEG) coating of the chamber walls. It may not be possible to use crotch absorbers to absorb the heat from the synchrotron radiation because an antechamber is difficult to realise with such a compact lattice. To solve this, the chamber walls can work as distributed absorbers if they are made of a material with good thermal conductivity, and distributed cooling is used at the location where the synchrotron radiation hits the wall. The vacuum system of the 3 GeV storage ring of MAX IV is used as an example of possible solutions for vacuum technologies for diffraction-limited storage rings.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Monitoring of their individual impedances and effects has been carried out with measurements on the electron beam after each new installation. The subsequent evolutions of the total longitudinal and transverse impedances are presented in this paper. Furthermore, in contradiction with the foreseen single-bunch effect, noticeable excitations of particular narrow band longitudinal coupled multibunch instabilities as a function of the position of the blades of the vertical scraper have been observed. In order to achieve a deeper insight of the phenomenon, an exhaustive characterization of both the longitudinal and transverse impedances of the scraper has been carried out.},

The transition from the regime of a cavity to the regime of a step is explained, an ap- proximate formula describing this transition is given, and the criterion for determining the applicability of each regime is established. The asymptotic behavior of the impedance for a finite number Mof periodical- ly arranged cavities as a function ofM is studied. The difference in the behavior of the impedance for a single cavity and that for an infinite number of cavities is explained as the result of the interference of the diffracted waves.

A recently emerged serial femtosecond (fs) crystallography (SFX) approach using XFEL radiation overcomes some of the biggest hurdles of traditional crystallography related to radiation damage through the diffraction-before-destruction principle. Intense fs XFEL pulses enable high-resolution room-temperature structure determination of difficult-to-crystallize biological macromolecules, while simultaneously opening a new era of time-resolved structural studies. Here, we review the latest developments in instrumentation, sample delivery, data analysis, crystallization methods, and applications of SFX to important biological questions, and conclude with brief insights into the bright future of structural biology using XFELs. XFELs allow radiation damage to be overcome, enabling the determination of high-resolution room-temperature structures of difficult-to-crystallize proteins, for which only small crystals are available, and of extremely radiation-sensitive macromolecules, such as metalloenzymes. De novo phasing at XFELs has been established on several different targets and by different methods, thereby enabling the determination of the structure of novel macromolecules of biological interest. The extremely short fs duration of XFEL pulses provides access to dynamic information about unstable intermediate states and irreversible reactions. The development of new injectors, crystal delivery media, and fixed target devices has dramatically reduced the amount of required crystallized protein. Mixing injectors provide an important avenue to study biological interactions in 4D space. Developments in data-processing software have reduced the required amount of data and improved data quality.},

abstract = {High-power, pulsed, coherent, far-infrared (FIR) radiation has many scientific applications, such as pump-probe studies of surfaces, liquids, and solids, studies of high-Tc, superconductors, biophysics, plasma diagnostics, and excitation of Rydberg atoms. Few sources of such FIR radiation currently exist. Superradiant undulator radiation produced at the SUNSHINE (Stanford UNiversity SHort INtense Electron-source) is such a FIR source. First proposed in the mm-wave spectral range by Motz, superradiant undulator radiation has been realized in the 45 um to 300 um spectral range by using sub-picosecond electron bunches produced by the SUNSHINE facility. The experimental setup and measurements of this FIR radiation are reported in this thesis. In addition to being a useful FIR source, the superradiant undulator radiation produced at SUNSHINE is an object of research in itself. Measured superlinear growth of the radiated energy along the undulator demonstrates the self-amplification of radiation by the electron bunch. This superlinear growth is seen at 47 um to 70 um wavelengths. These wavelengths are an order of magnitude shorter than in previous self-amplification demonstrations.},

abstract = {To fully exploit the ultimate source properties of the next-generation light sources, such as free-electron lasers (FELs) and diffraction-limited storage rings (DLSRs), the quality requirements for gratings and reflective synchrotron optics, especially mirrors, have significantly increased. These coherence-preserving optical components for high-brightness sources will feature nanoscopic shape accuracies over macroscopic length scales up to 1000 mm. To enable high efficiency in terms of photon flux, such optics will be coated with application-tailored single or multilayer coatings. Advanced thin-film fabrication of today enables the synthesis of layers on the sub-nanometre precision level over a deposition length of up to 1500 mm. Specifically dedicated metrology instrumentation of comparable accuracy has been developed to characterize such optical elements. Second-generation slope-measuring profilers like the nanometre optical component measuring machine (NOM) at the BESSY-II Optics laboratory allow the inspection of up to 1500 mm-long reflective optical components with an accuracy better than 50 nrad r.m.s. Besides measuring the shape on top of the coated mirror, it is of particular interest to characterize the internal material properties of the mirror coating, which is the domain of X-rays. Layer thickness, density and interface roughness of single and multilayer coatings are investigated by means of X-ray reflectometry. In this publication recent achievements in the field of slope measuring metrology are shown and the characterization of different types of mirror coating demonstrated. Furthermore, upcoming challenges to the inspection of ultra-precise optical components designed to be used in future FEL and DLSR beamlines are discussed.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring, currently under construction, pursues the goal of low electron beam emittance by using a multi-bend achromat magnet lattice, which is realised by having several consecutive magnet elements precision-machined out of a common solid iron block, 2.3–3.4 m long. With this magnet design solution, instead of having 1320 individual magnets, the MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring is built up using 140 integrated `magnet block' units, containing all these magnet elements. Major features of this magnet block design are compactness, vibration stability and that the alignment of magnet elements within each unit is given by the mechanical accuracy of the CNC machining rather than individual field measurement and adjustment. This article presents practical engineering details of implementing this magnet design solution, and mechanical + magnetic field measurement results from the magnet production series. At the time of writing (spring 2014), the production series, which is totally outsourced to industry, is roughly half way through, with mechanical/magnetic QA conforming to specifications. It is the conclusion of the authors that the MAX IV magnet block concept, which has sometimes been described as new or innovative, is from a manufacturing point of view simply a collection of known mature production methods and measurement procedures, which can be executed at fixed cost with a low level of risk.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Re- cently, a discussion on timing modes at theMAXIV storage rings has been initiated by the user community. This implies operating the rings with other fill patterns than the originally planned multibunch mode and therefore detailed studies of the performance of the harmonic cavities are of interest.

In order to understand the contribution of the vacuum chambers and its dependence on the gap, the distribution of the vertical transverse impedance around the circumference of the APS storage ring has been determined using the response matrix fit method. This method allows us to find focusing errors around the storage ring and was originally used to determine and correct the linear model of the APS. The high accuracy of the method enables us to measure the variation of betatron phase advance around the ring with beam current. Results of these measurements are reported and the impedance of different parts of the storage ring is presented.},

abstract = {The NSLS-II storage ring is designed to operate with superconducting RF-cavities with the aim to store an average current of 500 mA distributed in 1080 bunches, with a gap in the uniform filling for ion clearing. At the early stage of the commissioning (phase 1), characterized by a bare lattice without damping wigglers and without Landau cavities, a normal conducting 7-cell PETRA-III RF-cavity structure has been installed with the goal to store an average current of 25 mA. In this paper we discuss our analysis of coupled-bunch instabilities driven by the Higher Order Modes (HOMs) of the 7-cell PETRA-III RF-cavity. As a cure of the instabilities, we apply a well-known scheme based on a proper detuning of the HOMs frequencies based upon cavity temperature change, and the use of the beneficial effect of the slow head-tail damping at positive chromaticity to increase the transverse coupled-bunch instability thresholds. In addition, we discuss measurements of coupled-bunch instabilities observed during the phase 1 commissioning of the NSLS-II storage ring. In our analysis we rely, in the longitudinal case, on the theory of coupled-bunch instability for uniform fillings, while in the transverse case we complement our studies with numerical simulations with OASIS, a novel parallel particle tracking code for self-consistent simulations of collective effects driven by short and long-range wakefields.},

Three distinct ranges of the excited field are studied: the long multiturn regime in multibunch fillings, the medium regime involving neighboring bunches, and the short intrabunch regime. Two theoretical models, which both take into account the field diffusion across chamber walls of finite thickness, are employed to compare the measurement with theoretical expectations. Specific experimental methods, based respectively upon orbit analysis, bunch-by-bunch transverse feedback and a single particle betatron resonance, are introduced to measure the incoherent focusing effect in the three regimes. It is found that the excited incoherent fields can be large enough to affect the ring performance. The non-negligible contribution of nonevaporable getter coating is shown to improve the agreement between measurements and calculations.},

abstract = {We present an explanation for the opposite signs of the horizontal and vertical tune shifts of bunch trains which have been observed recently in several high-energy storage rings. This result can be understood in terms of the long-range quadrupolar wakes of noncircular vacuum chambers with finite resistivity. In vacuum chambers with circular cross section, the dominant transverse wake driven by a leading particle and seen by a trailing test particle is dipolar and is proportional only to the transverse offset of the driving particle. The contributions of preceding bunches or previous turns tend to cancel, as they add with oscillatory factors. On the other hand, quadrupolar wakes are independent of the offset of the driving particle, and thus the contributions of preceding bunches and turns are strictly additive. Since quadrupole fields are focusing in one plane and defocusing in the plane orthogonal to it, their effects on tune shifts in these planes have opposite signs. Their cumulative effect also explains the large values of the tune shifts measured in PEP-II, which exceeded estimates from other impedance sources by factors of 3 to 4. Our analysis also offers a connection to the familiar Laslett tune shift.},

abstract = {The Advanced Photon Source storage ring has a number of narrow-gap insertion device vacuum chambers, and there is a plan to further increase their number. These vacuum chambers contribute to the impedance of the machine and to the impedance limits the single-bunch current threshold. In order to understand the contribution of the vacuum chambers and its dependence on the gap, the distribution of the vertical transverse impedance around the circumference of the APS storage ring has been determined using the response matrix fit method. This method allows us to find focusing errors around the storage ring and was originally used to determine and correct the linear model of the APS. The high accuracy of the method enables us to measure the variation of betatron phase advance around the ring with beam current. Results of these measurements are reported and the impedance of different parts of the storage ring is presented.},

In contrast to a single-bunch integrated impedance measurement these techniques resolve the impedances in the frequency domain. These methods allow determination of the impedance's unaliased frequency by analyzing synchronous phase transients. Experimental results from ALS and BESSY-II are presented showing the use of these techniques to measure complex impedances.},

abstract = {The dynamics of charged particles in general linear focusing lattices with quadrupole, skew-quadrupole, dipole, and solenoidal components, as well as torsion of the fiducial orbit and variation of beam energy is parametrized using a generalized Courant-Snyder (CS) theory, which extends the original CS theory for one degree of freedom to higher dimensions. The envelope function is generalized into an envelope matrix, and the phase advance is generalized into a 4D symplectic rotation, or a Uð2Þ element. The 1D envelope equation, also known as the Ermakov-Milne-Pinney equation in quantum mechanics, is generalized to an envelope matrix equation in higher dimensions. Other components of the original CS theory, such as the transfer matrix, Twiss functions, and CS invariant (also known as the Lewis invariant) all have their counterparts, with remarkably similar expressions, in the generalized theory. The gauge group structure of the generalized theory is analyzed. By fixing the gauge freedom with a desired symmetry, the generalized CS parametrization assumes the form of the modified Iwasawa decomposition, whose importance in phase space optics and phase space quantum mechanics has been recently realized. This gauge fixing also symmetrizes the generalized envelope equation and expresses the theory using only the generalized Twiss function $\beta$. The generalized phase advance completely determines the spectral and structural stability properties of a general focusing lattice. For structural stability, the generalized CS theory enables application of the Krein-Moser theory to greatly simplify the stability analysis. The generalized CS theory provides an effective tool to study coupled dynamics and to discover more optimized lattice designs in the larger parameter space of general focusing lattices.},

abstract = {The MAX IV facility, currently under construction in Lund, Sweden, features two electron storage rings operated at 3 GeV and 1.5 GeV and optimized for the hard X-ray and soft X-ray/VUV spectral ranges, respectively. A 3 GeV linear accelerator serves as a full-energy injector into both rings as well as a driver for a short-pulse facility, in which undulators produce X-ray pulses as short as 100 fs. The 3 GeV ring employs a multibend achromat (MBA) lattice to achieve, in a relatively short circumference of 528 m, a bare lattice emittance of 0.33 nm rad, which reduces to 0.2 nm rad as insertion devices are added. The engineering implementation of the MBA lattice raises several technological problems. The large number of strong magnets per achromat calls for a compact design featuring small-gap combined-function magnets grouped into cells and sharing a common iron yoke. The small apertures lead to a low-conductance vacuum chamber design that relies on the chamber itself as a distributed copper absorber for the heat deposited by synchrotron radiation, while non-evaporable getter (NEG) coating provides for reduced photodesorption yields and distributed pumping. Finally, a low main frequency (100 MHz) is chosen for the RF system yielding long bunches, which are further elongated by passively operated third-harmonic Landau cavities, thus alleviating collective effects, both coherent (e.g. resistive wall instabilities) and incoherent (intrabeam scattering). In this paper, we focus on the MAX IV 3 GeV ring and present the lattice design as well as the engineering solutions to the challenges inherent to such a design. As the first realisation of a light source based on the MBA concept, the MAX IV 3 GeV ring offers an opportunity for validation of concepts that are likely to be essential ingredients of future diffraction-limited light sources.},

Computer code GdfidL is used for the estimate of impedances in some of above structures. A new method for measurement of transverse coupling impedance has been used. The method is based on measuring of closed orbit deviation caused by localized impedance. Transverse impedance acts on the beam as a defocusing quadrupole, strength of which depends on the beam current. If a local bump of closed orbit has been created at the impedance location, then the orbit deviation occurs while varying the beam current. The local impedance can be evaluated using the orbit deviation measured. The results of the measurements and numerical calculations are presented and compared.},

abstract = {The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) hosted at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research in Geneva, Switzerland, is the world's largest particle accelerator. With a circumference of 27 km, it can bring proton beams into collitions at a centre of mass energy of 14 TeV. It has been conceived and built to let scientific research to explore the high energy physics frontiers, keeping collision events at a design luminiosity of 1034 cm−2s−1. Beyond this goal challenging in itself, the High Luminosity LHC (HiLumi-LHC) project aims at increasing the LHC luminosity by an order of magnitude and one of the key ingredients to achieve that is to increase beam intensity. In order to keep beam instabilities under control and to avoid excessive power losses a careful design of new vacuum chamber components and continuous update and improvement of the LHC impedance model are required. Collimators are among the major impedance contributors. During LHC Run I, measurements with beam have revealed that the betatron coherent tune shifts were higher by about a factor of 2 with respect to the theoretical predictions based on the impedance model up to 2012. In that model the resistive wall impedance was considered as the dominating impedance contribution for collimators. By means of GdfidL electromagnetic code simulations, the geometric impedance of secondary and tertiary (TCS/TCT) collimators' real structures (i.e. not simplified) was calculated, contributing to the update of the LHC impedance model. This resulted also in a better agreement between the measured and simulated betatron tune shifts. During the LHC Long Shutdown I (LS I), some of the Run I TCS and TCT collimators were replaced by new devices, embedding Beam Position Monitor (BPM) pick-up buttons in the tapering regions, in order to provide accurate and continuous measurements of the beam centres, and ferrite blocks for the damping of the Higher Order Modes (HOMs) trapped in the collimators' structure. The injection collimators (TDI) are undergoing a substantial design review and upgrade study stage, as part of the whole LHC injection protection system upgrade foreseen to be finished in the LHC LS II (2018-2019). Measurements performed during LHC Run I have shown that the presently installed TDIs contribute significantly to both longitudinal and transverse impedance, determining beam induced heating and high vacuum pressure that affected background of experiments. In the view of higher intensities planned for the Run III and HiLumi-LHC operations, all these impedance related issues have to be minimized. The aim of this work was to perform accurate simulations of collimators' impedance, which has become very important and challenging. Accurate does mean as close as possible to the real conditions. Thus, in order to afford such a task, the huge collimators' CAD designs were used as input into GdfidL code. Besides, several dedicated tests have been performed to verify correct simulations of lossy dispersive material properties, such as resistive wall and ferrites, benchmarking code results with analytical, semi-analytical and other numerical codes outcomes. The results of the collimators wake fields and impedances calculations, together with their comparison with experimental measurements are shown and discussed.},

abstract = {A fast transverse single bunch instability has been observed and has restricted the stored currents in several storage rings, e.g. PEP and PETRA. This paper describes a method, which is the generalization of Sacherer's theory without mode couplings, to analyze the fast transverse instability in a Gaussian bunch. This method includes the radial modes and requires negative azimuthal modes. It makes clear that the fast instability in PEP and PETRA is caused by the mode coupling between the azimuthal modes m = 0 and m = -1, and that its growth rate rises very rapidly above the threshold. The method also predicts that the threshold current could not be improved by a large factor even if the bunch length is increased to several centimeters. The TRISTAN threshold current estimated by scaling from the PEP experimental data is about 3.5 mA per bunch for the worst case. ?? 1983.},

Inthe typical experiment, the theory is used to determine the impedance of the ring. What has been lacking thus far, however, is a calculation of bunch lengthening that uses a carefully calculated ring impedance (or wakefield). In this paper we begin by finding the potential well distortion due to some very simple impedance models, in order to illustrate different types of bunch lengthening behavior. Whe then give a prescription for extending potential well calculations indo the turbulent regime one the threshold is known. Then finally, using the wakefield calculated in Ref. 1 for the SLC damping rings, combined with the measured value of the threshold given in Ref. 2, we calculate bunch lengthening for the damping rings, and compare the results with the measuments.},

A feedback system has been developed, installed and commissioned at the VEPP-4M electron-positron collider. An original scheme of the kicker powering has been developed to provide the necessary performance with minimal expenses.

The new light source will consist of a low emittance storage ring based on the use of permanent magnet technology for the dipoles. An innovative approach is adopted to enhance the performance of the storage ring dipoles by combining low field (0.5 T) magnets for the main beam deflection and a short slice of high field magnet. This short slice will create a high bending field (2.0 T) only over a short longitudinal extent, generating high critical photon energy with modest energy loss from the complete dipole. There are several attractive features in this proposal, including necessity for lower RF power, less heating of the vacuum chambers and possibility to reduce the beam emittance by placing the longitudinal field gradient at a favorable place.},

abstract = {Injection into the two MAX IV storage rings will not make use of a 4-kicker local injection bump. Instead, pulsed multipole injection will be used for initial filling as well as top-up injection. Since commissioning a pulsed multipole magnet for injection into a storage ring is non-trivial, it has been decided to install a single dipole kicker magnet into the storage rings to provide a simple method for injection during early commissioning. Design studies have revealed that injection with a single dipole kicker into the MAX IV storage rings is not only efficient, but also allows for accumulation of beam. Although this accumulation cannot be made transparent to users (i.e. it is not compatible with user top-up operation), it does provide a simple and robust injection method during commissioning. In addition, the dipole kicker can be used as a pinger magnet during machine studies with a single-bunch filling. This paper reports on the design studies performed for dipole kicker injection into the MAX IV storage rings and presents a summary of the expected performance of such an injection scheme. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Several other projects are in the design stage and these will probably enhance the performance further. To translate the progress in light source quality into new science requires similar progress in aspects such as optics, beamline technology, detectors and data analysis. The quality of new science will be limited by the weakest component in this value chain. Breakthroughs can be expected in high-resolution imaging, microscopy and spectroscopy.

abstract = {The Yee finite-difference time domain method (FDTD) is commonly used in wake field and particle-in-cell simulations. However, in accelerator modeling the high energy particles can travel in vacuum faster than their own radiation. This effect is commonly referred to as numerical Cherenkov radiation and is a consequence of numerical grid dispersion. Several numerical approaches are proposed to reduce the dispersion for all angles and for a given frequency range, that justifies itself for domains big in all three directions. On the contrary, in accelerator modeling the transverse dimensions and transverse beam velocity are small, but it is extremely important to eliminate the dispersion error in the well-defined direction of the beam motion for all frequencies. In this paper we propose a new two-level economical conservative scheme for electromagnetic field calculations in three dimensions. The scheme does not have dispersion in the longitudinal direction and is staircase-free (second order convergent). Unlike the FDTD method, it is based on a “transversal-electric/transversal-magnetic” (TE/TM)-like splitting of the field components in time. The scheme assures energy and charge conservation. Additionally, the usage of damping terms allows suppressing high frequency noise generated due to the transverse dispersion and the current fluctuations. The dispersion relation of the damping scheme is analyzed. As numerical examples show, the new scheme is much more accurate on the long-time scale than the conventional FDTD approach. },

abstract = {Theory and experimental results are presented for a basically new type of electron-stream amplifier in which the stream flows near a resistive wall. The values of gain and bandwidth obtainable are found to be comparable to those of other microwave amplifiers, such as traveling-wave tubes. In contrast to such tubes, however, the gain is affected very little by appreciable changes in the circuit parameters or operating voltage; furthermore, self-oscillation is inherently absent because the input is effectively isolated from the output. Experiments are described that were performed mainly to verify the theory; the existence of the growing wave was demonstrated, and the measured gain was in good agreement with the theory.},

abstract = {this thesis is to design and optimize the RF-gun to achieve electron bunch length in femtosecond scale. Starting from the Stanford SUNSHINE design, the RF-gun has been optimized and constructed. These studies were performed by numerical simulation using the codes SUPERFISH and PARMELA. Systematic simulation studies were carried out to investigate the fundamental and practical limits in reducing the electron bunch length. The numerical studies include bunch length dispersion due to focusing in the transport system leading to a final bunch length of some 53 fs with a bunch charge of 94 pCb giving a peak current of 707 A. The RF-gun was constructed based on simulation results. Low-power RF measurements were performed and the results shows that the resonant frequency of the RF-gun is 2855.3 MHz at 25oC in ambient air, which can be tuned to 2856 MHz by adjusting the RF-gun temperature, and the quality factor is 12979 with the RF-coupling coefficient of about 7.5. The RF-gun and other components have been installed at the SURIYA project. The experimental results show that the electron beam of 2-2.5 MeV maximum kinetic energy and a beam current up to 1 A can be obtained from the RF-gun with input power of 3.65 MW. Electron bunches as short as 53 fs can be converted into broad band co- herent radiation in the high-intensity far-infrared (FIR) regime at wavelengths of 50-1000 µm. To verify the simulation results, a transition radiation experimental station to produce FIR transition radiation has been installed. Recently, the FIR signal from transition radiation was successfully observed and verified for the first time at SURIYA laboratory by using room temperature pyroelectric detector.},

Truncation ofthis determinant permits solution ofthe problem on a computer, and a code has been written which finds the complex mode frequencies. The stability limits are determined by equating the imaginary part of the solution to the radiation damping rate. The theory is applied to LEP at injection with third higher-harmonic cavities, and the results were compared with those obtained by the multi-particle simulation program.

For a quantitative analysis of most experiments, the wave field or at least the intensity distribution illuminating the sample is needed. We report on the full characterization of a nanofocused XFEL beam by ptychographic imaging, giving access to the complex wave field in the nanofocus. From these data, we obtain the full caustic of the beam, identify the aberrations of the optic, and determine the wave field for individual pulses.

abstract = {The dynamics of charged particles in general linear focusing lattices with quadrupole, skew-quadrupole, dipole, and solenoidal components, as well as torsion of the fiducial orbit and variation of beam energy is parametrized using a generalized Courant-Snyder (CS) theory, which extends the original CS theory for one degree of freedom to higher dimensions. The envelope function is generalized into an envelope matrix, and the phase advance is generalized into a 4D symplectic rotation, or a Uð2Þ element. The 1D envelope equation, also known as the Ermakov-Milne-Pinney equation in quantum mechanics, is generalized to an envelope matrix equation in higher dimensions. Other components of the original CS theory, such as the transfer matrix, Twiss functions, and CS invariant (also known as the Lewis invariant) all have their counterparts, with remarkably similar expressions, in the generalized theory. The gauge group structure of the generalized theory is analyzed. By fixing the gauge freedom with a desired symmetry, the generalized CS parametrization assumes the form of the modified Iwasawa decomposition, whose importance in phase space optics and phase space quantum mechanics has been recently realized. This gauge fixing also symmetrizes the generalized envelope equation and expresses the theory using only the generalized Twiss function {\$}\beta{\$}. The generalized phase advance completely determines the spectral and structural stability properties of a general focusing lattice. For structural stability, the generalized CS theory enables application of the Krein-Moser theory to greatly simplify the stability analysis. The generalized CS theory provides an effective tool to study coupled dynamics and to discover more optimized lattice designs in the larger parameter space of general focusing lattices.},

With X-ray pulse durations down to 10 fs or shorter, and up to 1013 transversely coherent photons per pulse in a narrow spectral bandwidth, focused irradiances of 1018 to 1021 W cm−2 or higher can be produced at X-ray energies ranging from 500 eV to 10 keV.

The algorithm is implemented in the new parallel tracking code SPACE (self-consistent parallel algorithm for collective effects) discussed in the paper. The code is applicable for accurate beam dynamics simulations in cases where both bunch-to-bunch and intrabunch motions need to be taken into account, such as chromatic head-tail effects on the coupled-bunch instability of a beam with a nonuniform filling pattern, or multibunch and single-bunch effects of a passive higher-harmonic cavity. The numerical simulations have been compared with analytical studies. For a beam with an arbitrary filling pattern, intensity-dependent complex frequency shifts have been derived starting from a system of coupled Vlasov equations. The analytical formulas and numerical simulations confirm that the analysis is reduced to the formulation of an eigenvalue problem based on the known formulas of the complex frequency shifts for the uniform filling pattern case.},

For such structures, we derive a Fourier representation of the wake potentials through one-dimensional functions. A new numerical approach for calculating the wakes in such structures is proposed and implemented in the computer code ECHO(2D). The computation resource requirements for this approach are moderate and comparable to those for finding the wakes in 2D rotationally symmetric structures.

The Circumference 528 m storage ring is designed to deliver ultra-low emittance down to 0.24 nm rad so as to provide high brightness synchrotron radiation from undulators. This is achieved in a comparatively small machine (528 m circumference) through the use of a multi-bend achromat lattice and a compact magnet design with multi-purpose narrow gap magnet blocks. This design features small dispersion leading to low momentum compaction, which, together with the small circular (11 mm radius) chambers, poses a challenge to reach the design current (500 mA in 176 bunches) without exciting instabilities and degrading beam parameters due to the interaction with the machine impedance. Particularly important are multi-bunch resistive wall effects in the NEG coated copper chamber as well single-bunch instabilities driven by the broad-band impedance. A low RF frequency (100 MHz) and harmonic cavities are foreseen to lengthen the bunches and increase instability thresholds.},

In some cases, the harmonic cavities may be tuned to fulfill the flat potential condition.With this condition met, it has been predicted in simulation that the threshold current for coupled-bunch resistive- wall instabilities is much higher than with no bunch lengthening at all. In this paper, the features of a bunch in the flat potential that would contribute toward this stabilization are identified and discussed. The threshold currents for these instabilities are estimated for the MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring at different values of chromaticity using macroparticle simulations in the time domain and, within the limits of the existing theory, frequency domain calculations. By comparing the results from these two methods and analyzing the spectra of the dominant head-tail modes, the impact of each of the distinguishing features of a bunch in the flat potential can be explained and quantified in terms of the change in threshold current. It is found that, above a certain chromaticity, the threshold current is determined by the radial structure of the zeroth-order head-tail mode. This happens at a lower chromaticity if the bunch length is longer.},

The method is based on measuring of a closed orbit deviation caused by local impedance. Transverse impedance acts on the beam as a defocusing quadrupole, strength of which depends on the beam current. If a local bump of closed orbit has been created at the impedance location, then the orbit deviation occurs while varying the beam current. The local impedance can be evaluated using the orbit deviation measured. Measurement technique is described, the method accuracy is evaluated. The method described was successfully used for measurement of the impedance distribution along the VEPP-4M storage ring.},

Beam instabilities and other intensity-dependent effects that may significantly impact the machine performance are covered. The latter include beam-induced machine heating, Touschek scattering, intra-beam scattering, as well as incoherent tune shifts. The general trend that the efforts to achieve ultra-low emittance result in increasing the machine coupling impedance and the beam sensitivity to instability is reviewed. The nature of coupling impedance in a DLSR is described, followed by a series of potentially dangerous beam instabilities driven by the former, such as resistive-wall, TMCI (transverse mode coupling instability), head{\{}--{\}}tail and microwave instabilities. In addition, beam-ion and CSR (coherent synchrotron radiation) instabilities are also treated. Means to fight against collective effects such as lengthening of the bunch with passive harmonic cavities and bunch-by-bunch transverse feedback are introduced. Numerical codes developed and used to evaluate the machine coupling impedance, as well as to simulate beam instability using the former as inputs are described.},

Calculation shows that a simplified approach based on the Vlasov equation can be taken when combined with an approximate stability criterion that the growth rate should be less than Imllt, where m is the azimuthal mode number and t is the radiation damping time for synchrotron oscillations. Fast instability occurs when coupling between different azimuthal modes is taken into account. The threshold of this instability calculated by the Fokker-Planck equation is almost equal to that obtained by the Vlasov equation. Thus radiation effects are shown to play little role in fast instability.},

However, a practical design of a ring having emittance approaching the diffraction limit for multi-keV photons, i.e. a diffraction-limited storage ring (DLSR), with a circumference of order 1 km or less was not possible before the development of small-aperture vacuum systems and other accelerator technology, together with an evolution in the understanding and accurate simulation of non-linear beam dynamics, had taken place. The 3-GeV MAX IV project in Sweden has initiated a new era of MBA storage ring light source design, i.e. a fourth generation, with the Sirius project in Brazil now following suit, each having an order of magnitude smaller horizontal emittance than third-generation machines. The ESRF, APS and SPring-8 are all exploring 6-GeV MBA lattice conversions in the imminent future while China is considering a similar-energy green-field machine. Other lower-energy facilities, including the ALS, SLS, Soleil, Diamond and others, are studying the possibility of such conversions. Future larger-circumference rings, possibly housed in {\textgreater}2-km tunnels made available by decommissioned high-energy physics accelerators, could have sub-10-pm-rad emittances, providing very high coherence for {\textgreater}10-keV X-rays.

abstract = {The development of modern accelerator and free-electron laser projects often requires one to consider wakefields of very short bunches in arbitrary three-dimensional structures. To obtain the wake numerically by direct integration of fields is difficult, since it can take a long time for fields scattered off the structure to catch up to the short bunch. On the other hand, no general algorithm for indirect wakefield integration exists in the literature. In this report we review the known indirect methods to compute wake potentials in rotationally symmetric and cavitylike three-dimensional structures. We present several extensions to the existing techniques and then derive a new general indirect method for arbitrary three-dimensional structures. Finally, the new method is numerically tested and applied to the problem of a rectangular collimator.},

abstract = {The installation of a second RF cavity in the UVX elec- tron storage ring at the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Lab- oratory (LNLS) at the end of 2003 brought about lon- gitudinal instabilities driven by one of the HOMs of the new cavity. Even though the operational difficulties re- lated to these unstable modes were successfully overcome by means of a combination of cavity tuning (using temper- ature and plunger adjustments) with phase modulation of the RF fields at the second harmonic of the synchrotron fre- quency, a more appropriate technique to avoid those prob- lems is the use of higher harmonic cavities, which have the important advantage of providing damping of the longitu- dinal modes without increasing the energy spread. In this work we present the design of a passive higher harmonic cavity (HHC) system optimized for operation at the LNLS storage ring.

abstract = {Explosions are spectacular and intriguing phenomena that expose the dynamics of matter under extreme conditions. We investigated, using time-resolved imaging, explosions induced by ultraintense X-ray laser pulses in water drops and jets. Our observations revealed an explosive vaporization followed by high-velocity interacting flows of liquid and vapour, and by the generation of shock trains in the liquid jets. These flows are diierent from those previously observed in laser ablation, owing to a simpler spatial pattern of X-ray absorption. We show that the explosion dynamics in our experiments is consistent with a redistribution of absorbed energy, mediated by a pressure or shock wave in the liquid, and we model the eeects of explosions, including their adverse impact on X-ray laser experiments. X-ray laser explosions have predictable dynamics that may prove useful for controlling the state of pure liquids over broad energy scales and timescales, and for triggering pressure-sensitive molecular dynamics in solutions. E xplosions are encountered in a wide range of natural and man-made systems. From supernovae at astrophysical scales 1 , to the laser-induced microexplosions that are used in laser surgery 2 , explosions generate high energy densities that transform rapidly into heat and kinetic energy. These processes can provide unique insights into the properties and dynamics of matter under extreme conditions 3,4 . To study the release of high energy densities, explosions can be produced safely and conveniently by illuminating microscopic volumes of matter with high-energy laser pulses 4,5 . An example of such a process is the laser ablation of liquid water 6–15 , which is an important and interesting system in its own right, but is also relevant to applications of ablation, because bulk water is used as a model of soft biological tissue in laser surgery 2,16 . Laser ablation in bulk water includes separable and quantifiable processes of nonlinear optical absorption, formation of plasma bubbles, and generation of shock waves 6–8 . Also, laser ablation in micrometre-sized drops and jets of water can be used to study chemistry at high temperatures and pres-sures 9 , or to generate extreme ultraviolet light 12,17 . However, ablation in drops and jets generates complex hydrodynamic phenomena 10,11},

abstract = {The MAX IV storage rings, currently under construction in Lund, Sweden, will use third harmonic cavities operated passively to lengthen the bunches and alleviate collective instabilities. These cavities are an essential ingredient in the MAX IV design concept and are required for achieving the final design goals in terms of stored current, beam emittance, and beam lifetime—such performance challenges are in fact common to all recent ultralow emittance storage ring designs and harmonic cavities are currently under consideration in several laboratories. In this paper, we report on parametric studies comparing different harmonic cavity settings in terms of the resulting bunch length, peak bunch density, and incoherent synchrotron frequency spread for the MAX IV 3 GeV ring. The equilibrium longitudinal bunch density distribution was calculated by establishing a self-consistent equation for the bunch form factor, describing the bunch shape. The calculations are fully self-consistent in the sense that not only the amplitude but also the phase of the waves excited by the beam in the harmonic cavity were assumed to be a function of the bunch shape, which allowed us to explore a wide parameter range not restricted to the region close to the conditions for which the first and second derivatives of the total rf voltage are zero at the synchronous phase. Our results indicate that up to a factor 5 increase in rms bunch length is achievable with a purely passive system for theMAXIV 3 GeV ring while keeping a relatively large harmonic cavity detuning, thus limiting the unavoidable Robinson antidamping rate from the fundamental mode of a passively operated harmonic cavity to values below the synchrotron radiation damping rate. The paper is complemented by results of measurements performed in the MAX III storage ring, which showed good agreement with calculations following the fully self-consistent approach.},

abstract = {Low-emittance lattices for SRC were developed using the matching capabilities of the MAD program. Emittances 68-94{\%} lower than Aladdin were obtained in lattices which require no new hardware at a ring energy of 800MeV. With a single RF cavity, the low-emittance lattices have bunch lengths {\~{}}1/3 of Alddin and Touschek lifetimes (calculated by MAD) 35-118{\%} of Aladdin. When the SRC fourth-harmonic cavity is modeled, the bunch lengths of the low-emittance lattices are increased by a factor of {\~{}}4, versus a factor of 2.3 for Aladdin. Consequently, a lattice with emittance 68{\%} less than Aladdin, and source dimensions {\~{}}33-67{\%} lower than Aladdin, has a Touschek lifetime 18{\%} longer than Aladdin with a single RF cavity and 90{\%} longer than Aladdin with the harmonic cavity on line. This lattice is a promissing candidate for SRC.},

abstract = {Harmonic cavities have been used in storage rings to lengthen bunches and increase beam lifetimes dominated by Touschek scattering. Transient beam loading in the harmonic cavities generated by asym- metries in the fill pattern causes significant variation of the bunch synchronous phase and bunch length along the bunch train when the longitudinal restoring force has been reduced. This results in a significant reduction in the mean bunch lengthening and potential lifetime increase. We describe how beam current modulations give rise to transient effects much larger than expected from the linear model of the beam cavity interaction. We also develop a tracking simulation to predict results and apply this simulation to an analysis of the beam loading transients for the case of passive and active normal and superconducting third harmonic rf systems using Advanced Light Source parameters.},

The five key concepts enabling the above scenario are (i) to set the proper beam performance taking account of a role of the fourth generation source in the X-ray source evolution, (ii) to adopt advanced undulator technologies for the total system optimization, (iii) to reduce the power consumption as much as possible by reasonably integrat- ing innovative designs and technologies, (iv) to utilize the SACLA linac as an injector to the upgraded ring for the high performance operation, and (v) to minimize the blackout period for quick restart of the user operation.},

User operation for a broad and international user community should commence in 2015. The facility is comprised of two storage rings optimized for different wavelength ranges, a linac-based short-pulse facility and a free- electron laser for the production of coherent radiation. The main radiation source of MAX IV will be a 528multralow emittance storage ring operated at 3 GeV for the generation of high-brightness hard x rays. This storage ring was designed to meet the requirements of state-of-the-art insertion devices which will be installed in nineteen 5 m long dispersion-free straight sections. The storage ring is based on a novel multibend achromat design delivering an unprecedented horizontal bare lattice emittance of 0.33 nm rad and a vertical emittance below the 8 pmrad diffraction limit for 1 A ˚ radiation. In this paper we present the beam dynamics considerations behind this storage-ring design and detail its expected unique performance.},

The short- range wakepotential has been optimized taking into account vertical offset of RF fingers from their nominal position. The results were compared with data of bellows designed at other laboratories. Narrow-band impedance of the BPM Button has been studied. TE-modes in the BPM button were suppressed by a factor of 8 by modification of existing housings. Two new types of housings are shown. The total impedance of the NSLS-II storage ring is discussed in terms of the loss factor and the vertical kick factor for a 3mm-Gaussian bunch.},

abstract = {We present the multibunch tracking code mbtrack developed to simulate, in 6-dimensional phase space, single- and multibunch collective instabilities driven by short- and long-range wakefields in storage rings. Multiple bunches, each composed of a large number of macroparticles, are tracked, allowing simulation of both intra- and interbunch motions. Besides analytical impedance models, the code allows employment of numerical wake potentials computed with electromagnetic (EM) field solvers. The corresponding impedances are fitted to a number of known analytical functions and the coefficients obtained in the fit are used as an input to the code. mbtrack performs a dynamic treatment of long-range resistive-wall and harmonic cavity fields, which are likely to be the two major factors impacting multibunch collective motions in many present and future ring-based light sources. Furthermore, it is capable of simulating beam-ion interactions as well as transverse bunch-by-bunch feedback. We describe the physical effects considered in the code and their implementation, which makes use of parallel processing to significantly shorten the computation time. mbtrack is benchmarked against other codes and applied to the MAX IV 3GeV ring as an example, where the importance of the interplay of various physical effects as well as coupling among different degrees of freedom is demonstrated.},

@article{Migliorati2015,
abstract = {The simulation of beam dynamics in the presence of collective effects requires a strong computational effort to take into account, in a self-consistent way, the wakefield acting on a given charge and produced by all the others. Generally this is done by means of a convolution integral or sum. Moreover, if the electromagnetic fields consist of resonant modes with high quality factors, responsible, for example, for coupled bunch instabilities, a charge is also affected by itself in previous turns, and a very long record of wakefield must be properly taken into account. In this paper we present a new simulation code for the longitudinal beam dynamics in a circular accelerator, which exploits an alternative approach to the currently used convolution sum, reducing the computing time and avoiding the issues related to the length of wakefield for coupled bunch instabilities.With this approach it is possible to simulate, without the need for large computing power, simultaneously, the single and multibunch beam dynamics including intrabunch motion. Moreover, for a given machine, generally both the coupling impedance and the wake potential of a short Gaussian bunch are known. However, a classical simulation code needs in input the so- called “Green” function, that is the wakefield produced by a point charge, making necessary some manipulations to use the wake potential instead of the Green function. The method that we propose does not need the wakefield as input, but a particular fitting of the coupling impedance requiring the use of the resonator impedance model, thus avoiding issues related to the knowledge of the Green function. The same approach can also be applied to the transverse case and to linear accelerators as well.},

abstract = {The brightness of x-ray sources has been increased one to ten billion times by x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) that generate high intensity coherent photon pulses at wavelengths from nanometers to less than one angstrom and a duration of a few to 100 femtoseconds. For the first time XFELs allow for experimental exploration of the structure and dynamics of atomic and molecular systems at the angstrom-femtosecond space and time scale, creating new opportunities for scientific research in physics, chemistry, biology, material science and high energy density physics. This paper reviews the history of this development, concentrating on the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), the world's first hard x-ray XFEL. It also presents the physical principles on which XFELs are based, their present status and future developments, together with some recent experimental results in physics, chemistry and biology. LCLS success has spurred the worldwide construction of more XFELs; SACLA in Japan, XFEL and FLASH in Germany, Swiss FEL, Korean XFEL, Fermi in Italy. The characteristics of these other sources are also discussed.},

@article{Courant1958,
abstract = {The equations of motion of the particles in a synchrotron in which the field gradient index n=−(rB)∂B∂r varies along the equilibrium orbit are examined on the basis of the linear approximation. It is shown that if n alternates rapidly between large positive and large negative values, the stability of both radial and vertical oscillations can be greatly increased compared to conventional accelerators in which n is azimuthally constant and must lie between 0 and 1. Thus aperture requirements are reduced. For practical designs, the improvement is limited by the effects of constructional errors; these lead to resonance excitation of oscillations and consequent instability if 2$\nu$x or 2$\nu$z or $\nu$x + $\nu$z is integral, where $\nu$x and $\nu$z are the frequencies of horizontal and vertical betatron oscillations, measured in units of the frequency of revolution. The mechanism of phase stability is essentially the same as in a conventional synchrotron, but the radial amplitude of synchrotron oscillations is reduced substantially. Furthermore, at a “transition energy” E1 ≈ $\nu$xMc2 the stable and unstable equilibrium phases exchange roles, necessitating a jump in the phase of the radiofrequency accelerating voltage. Calculations indicate that the manner in which this jump is performed is not very critical.},

abstract = {In this thesis, the problemof the transverse coupled-bunch instabilities created by the LargeHadron Collider (LHC) beam-coupling impedance, that can possibly limit the machine operation, is addressed thanks to several new theories and tools. A rather complete vision of the problemis proposed here, going fromthe calculation of the impedances and wake functions of individual machine elements, to the beam dynamics study. Firstly, new results are obtained in the theory of the beam-coupling impedance for an axisymmetric two-dimensional structure, generalizing Zotter's theories, and a new general theory is derived for the impedance of an infinite flat two-dimensional structure. Then, a new approach has been found to compute thewake functions fromsuch analytically obtained beam-coupling impedances, over- coming limitations that could be met with standard discrete Fourier transformprocedures. Those results are then used to obtain an impedance andwake function model of the LHC, based on the (resistive-) wall impedances of various contributors (collimators, beamscreens and vacuumpipe) and additional estimations of the geometrical impedance contributions. Finally, the existing code HEADTAIL,which is a macroparticle simulation code for beam dynamics studies with wake fields, is improved to make possible the simulation ofmultibunch trains, and a spectral analysis technique is found to facilitate the analysis of the output given by this code, giving the complex tune shifts of the unstable modes present in a simulation. All those theories and tools are used to obtain new results concerning the LHC transverse coupled-bunch instabilities, demonstrating the rather small impact on coupled-bunch instabilities of the number of bunches in a train when the bunch spacing is fixed, and the existence of coupled-bunch modes with intrabunch motion which are more critical than their single-bunch counterparts. A full verification of the complete procedure (impedance theories, impedance model and simulation code) is also performed by comparing the simulation results with actualmeasurements in the LHC, giving a very good agreement at injection energy and a correct order ofmagnitude at 3.5 TeV/c. In the end, several predictions concerning the beam stability at the future 7 TeV/c operation of the machine are performed in the case of 50 ns spacing (1404 bunches), revealing that the coupled-bunch transverse mode coupling instability threshold is far above the ultimate bunch intensity but about 20{\%} smaller than its single-bunch counterpart. Stability studies with Landau octupoles at their maximumcurrents reveal that the beam remains stable at nominal intensity withQ? =2 in both planes, provided the particle transverse distributions are Gaussian. At ultimate intensity with eitherQ? =0 orQ? =2, or at nominal intensitywhen the chromaticity is zero, the beam happens to be unstable, even with the octupoles at theirmaximumcurrents.},

For example, the design for the Spallation Neutron Source storage ring specifies fractional beam losses of the order of 1024, so that even small instabilities or resonances can lead to the violation of this number. The purpose of this paper is to show that there exist potentially important beam fields, missing from standard analyses, that can lead either to instabilities or to large deviations of instability thresholds from their conventional values. Some of these fields and related effects, e.g., “fast damping,” were discovered earlier and are presented here in more standard form as an extension of the wake field's definition. In addition, nonrelativistic collective phenomena are analyzed. It is shown that the nonrelativistic case could be significantly different from the rela- tivistic case.},

Starting from the statistical optics and using mu- tual coherence function of the radiation field, we define the transverse and temporal coherence and modes. Spec- tral brightness can be represented in radiation phase-space via the Wigner function which is the Fourier transforma- tion of the transverse correlation function. The brightness convolution theorem can be employed to calculate the to- tal source brightness and the degree of transverse coher- ence of the radiation emitted by an electron beam. Undu- lator radiation possesses partial transverse coherence until the beam emittances can be reduced below the diffraction limit. For x-ray FELs the radiation has excellent transverse coherence and at least 9 orders of magnitude enhancement in peak brightness. Seeding can further improve temporal coherence of FELs. Future development includes diffrac- tion limited light sources, higher peak and average power x-ray FELs and compact coherent radiation sources based on laser and plasma accelerators.},

abstract = {this thesis is to design and optimize the RF-gun to achieve electron bunch length in femtosecond scale. Starting from the Stanford SUNSHINE design, the RF-gun has been optimized and constructed. These studies were performed by numerical simulation using the codes SUPERFISH and PARMELA. Systematic simulation studies were carried out to investigate the fundamental and practical limits in reducing the electron bunch length. The numerical studies include bunch length dispersion due to focusing in the transport system leading to a final bunch length of some 53 fs with a bunch charge of 94 pCb giving a peak current of 707 A. The RF-gun was constructed based on simulation results. Low-power RF measurements were performed and the results shows that the resonant frequency of the RF-gun is 2855.3 MHz at 25oC in ambient air, which can be tuned to 2856 MHz by adjusting the RF-gun temperature, and the quality factor is 12979 with the RF-coupling coefficient of about 7.5. The RF-gun and other components have been installed at the SURIYA project. The experimental results show that the electron beam of 2-2.5 MeV maximum kinetic energy and a beam current up to 1 A can be obtained from the RF-gun with input power of 3.65 MW. Electron bunches as short as 53 fs can be converted into broad band co- herent radiation in the high-intensity far-infrared (FIR) regime at wavelengths of 50-1000 µm. To verify the simulation results, a transition radiation experimental station to produce FIR transition radiation has been installed. Recently, the FIR signal from transition radiation was successfully observed and verified for the first time at SURIYA laboratory by using room temperature pyroelectric detector.},

abstract = {After a brief summary of the ideas underlying the quantum theory of dispersion it is shown that it can be applied to the refraction of x-rays, although the assumption that the number of atoms in a wave length cube is large is no longer satisfied. A general formula for the index of refraction in terms of the atomic absorption coefficient {\$}\backslashalpha{\$} and the critical frequencies is given. From the condition, experimentally verified, that the electrons in the atom for impressed frequencies, large compared to their natural frequencies, shall act like free electrons as far as the index of refraction is concerned, a relation is obtained for {\$}\backslashalpha{\$}. From the failure of this relation when applied to the groups of electrons separately, conclusions are drawn as to the coupling of the groups. Some considerations on the origin of the Compton shifted radiation are added, from which it appears that in the wave description this radiation must be regarded as coming from all the atoms and as being coherent with the incident waves; a result suited to stress the difficulty of harmonizing the wave picture with that of quantum processes in the atoms.1},

For shielded CSR we show that only two dimensionless parameters, the shielding parameter  and the strength parameter Scsr, are needed to describe the system.

The convergence of the expansion is confirmed by computer calculation to be very rapid. Compared with the Vlasov equation treatment, the threshold of transverse mode-coupling instability in PEP, PETRA, and TRISTAN is shown to be somewhat lowered, owing to radiation effects. Dipole oscillations are excited before the eigenfrequencies of two modes (m = 0 and m = -1) meet. It is also shown that when the Vlasov equation is used to study the coupled-bunch instability an approximate stability criterion is that the growth rate should be less than 1/t'{\~{}} + Iml/t's' where t'{\~{}} and t's are radiation damping times for betatron and synchrotron oscillations, respectively, and m is the azimuthal mode number.

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the electromagnetic interaction between a point charge travelling inside a waveguide of elliptical cross section, and the waveguide itself. By using a convenient expansion of the Mathieu functions, useful in particular for treating a variety of problems in applied mathematics and physics with elliptic geometry, we first obtain the longitudinal electromagnetic field of a point charge (Green's function) in free space in terms of elliptical coordinates. This expression allows, then, to calculate the scattered field due to the boundary conditions in our geometry. By summing the contribution of the direct or primary field and the indirect field scattered by the boundary, after a careful choice of some expansion expressions, we derive a novel formula of the longitudinal electric field, in any transverse position of the elliptical cross section, generated by the charge moving along the longitudinal axis of the waveguide. The obtained expression is represented in a closed form, it can be differentiated and integrated, it can be used to fully describe the radiation process of a particle beam travelling inside a waveguide of elliptical cross section, and it is valid for any elliptic geometry. The equations are used to evaluate the coupling impedance due to indirect space charge in case of elliptical geometry. In addition, they are useful as preliminary studies for the determination of the coupling impedance in different cases involving elliptic vacuum chambers, as, for example, the effect of the finite conductivity of the beam pipe wall or the geometrical variation of the vacuum chamber due to elliptic step transitions existing in some accelerators.},

abstract = {Sirius isa3GeV synchrotron light source that is being built by the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS). The electron storage ring uses the multi-bend-achromat ap- proach (5BA in this case) to achieve a very low beam emit- tance of 0.28 nm.rad. The 518 m circumference contains 20 straight sections of alternating 6 and 7 meters in length, to be used for insertion devices as well as injection and RF sys- tems. The 5BA cell is modified to accommodate a thin high field dipole (for 1.4◦ deflection) in the center of the middle bend producing hardX-ray radiation (12 keVcritical energy) with a modest contribution to the total energy loss. This high field dipole (2.0 T) will be made of permanent magnet material, whereas the low field (0.58 T) ones, responsible for the main beam deflection, will be electromagnetic. Many challenges are associated with this kind of lattice, including both in beam dynamics and accelerator engineering, that require R{\&}D on new techniques. In this paper we discuss the main issues and achievements for Sirius in the last year.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a new two particle model for studying the strong head-tail instabilities in the presence of the space-charge force. It is a simple expansion of the well-known two particle model for strong head-tail instability and is still analytically solvable. No chromaticity effect is included. It leads to a formula for the growth rate as a function of the two dimensionless parameters: the space-charge tune shift parameter (normalized by the synchrotron tune) and the wakefield strength, ϒ. The three-dimensional contour plot of the growth rate as a function of those two dimensionless parameters reveals stopband structures. Many simulation results generally indicate that a strong head-tail instability can be damped by a weak space- charge force, but the beam becomes unstable again when the space-charge force is further increased. The newtwo particle model indicates a similar behavior. In weak space-charge regions, additional tune shifts by the space-charge force dissolve the mode coupling. As the space-charge force is increased, they conversely restore the mode coupling, but then a further increase of the space-charge force decouples the modes again. This mode coupling/decoupling behavior creates the stopband structures.},

Sextupole and octupole strengths are determined using a multi-objective genetic al- gorithm (MOGA) and result in sufficient dynamic aperture for off-axis injection and several hours of Touschek lifetime. Superconducting LGBs of 5–6 T peak field will extend the photon range of the SLS up to 80–100 keV.

abstract = {The ASTeC Vacuum Science Group has an ongoing study for the improvement of the nonevaporable getter (NEG) coatings currently used in many accelerators around the world. The main advantages of using NEG coatings are evenly distributed pumping speed, low thermal outgassing rates, and low photon-stimulated gas desorption and electron-stimulated gas desorption (ESD). Previously, it was shown that the dense NEG coating provides lower ESD compared to that of a columnar film, but its pumping properties are reduced. This paper describes the results for a dual layer of NEG where a dense layer was deposited first and a columnar layer was then deposited on top. In such a dual-layer NEG coating, the dense layer acted as a barrier for hydrogen diffusion and the columnar layer further reduced the ESD of hydrogen and provided improved pumping properties. An alloy target of Ti-Zr-Hf-V was used to deposit a 0.5 lm-thick layer of the dense NEG followed by a 1 lm-thick columnar structure of NEG onto the inner surface of a 50-cm long stainless steel tube. The composition and the structure of the dual layer were determined by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. The NEG vacuum performance was tested using the ESD and pumping properties, which were measured on a dedi- cated in-house designed facility.},

abstract = {In this paper we discuss representations of charge particle densities in particle-in-cell simulations, analyze the sources and profiles of the intrinsic numerical noise, and present efficient methods for their removal. We devise two alternative estimation methods for charged particle distribution which represent significant improvement over the Monte Carlo cosine expansion used in the 2D code of Bassi et al., designed to simulate coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) in charged particle beams. The improvement is achieved by employing an alternative beam density estimation to the Monte Carlo cosine expansion. The representation is first binned onto a finite grid, after which two grid-based methods are employed to approximate particle distributions: (i) truncated fast cosine transform; and (ii) thresholded wavelet transform (TWT). We demonstrate that these alternative methods represent a staggering upgrade over the original Monte Carlo cosine expansion in terms of efficiency, while the TWT approximation also provides an appreciable improvement in accuracy. The improvement in accuracy comes from a judicious removal of the numerical noise enabled by the wavelet formulation. The TWT method is then integrated into the CSR code, and benchmarked against the original version. We show that the new density estimation method provides a superior performance in terms of efficiency and spatial resolution, thus enabling high-fidelity simulations of CSR effects, including microbunching instability. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

Subsequently, the corresponding wake functions are derived by performing inverse Fourier transformations numerically.

The constants involved in these systems have been determined by matching boundary conditions at the interface vacuum wall.

For an electron circulating midway between parallel plates, the method of image charges is used to derive the wakefield, exhibit a scaling property and evaluate the scaling functions. As a complement to the time-domain ana- lysis of the wakefield, we discuss its frequency-domain counterpart, the longitudinal coupling impedance.

Computer code GdfidL is used for the estimate of impedances in some of above structures. A new method for measurement of transverse coupling impedance has been used. The method is based on measuring of closed orbit deviation caused by localized impedance. Transverse impedance acts on the beam as a defocusing quadrupole, strength of which depends on the beam current. If a local bump of closed orbit has been created at the impedance location, then the orbit deviation occurs while varying the beam current. The local impedance can be evaluated using the orbit deviation measured. The results of the measurements and numerical calculations are presented and compared.},

abstract = {Although beamline instrumentation is by nature driven by science, some recent examples serve as reminders that new technologies also enable new science. Indeed, exploiting the full scientific potential of forthcoming new storage rings with unprecedented source characteristics will, in many cases, require the development and implementation of novel instrumentation. In comparison with present synchrotron radiation facilities, the majority of beamlines should reap immediate performance benefits from the improved source emittance, principally through increased flux and/or horizontal beam size reduction at the sample. Instrumentation will have to develop along similar quantitative and qualitative trends. More speculative and more challenging is anticipating instrumentation that will be required by the new science made possible thanks to the unique coherence properties of diffraction-limited storage rings (DLSRs). ESRF has recently carried out a detailed feasibility study for a new ultra-low-emittance 6 GeV hybrid multibend storage ring, identified as ESRF Upgrade Programme Phase II. Although its performance is not expected to be equivalent to a DLSR source, the successful implementation of the ESRF Phase II project has to address scientific instrumentation issues that are also common to DLSRs. This article aims at providing a comprehensive review of some of the challenges encountered by the ESRF, in the context of the preparation of Phase II of its upgrade programme.},

These emittances include the contribution of intrabeam scattering at a nominal current of 200 mA in 3300 bunches. This quality beam in conjunction with a conventional 4-m undulator in a straight section can generate synchrotron radiation having a spectral brightness above 1022[photons/s/mm2/mrad2/0.1{\%}BW] at a 10 keV photon energy. The high coherence at the diffraction limit makes this design competitive with 4th generation light sources based on an energy recovery linac. In addition, the beam lifetime is several hours and the dynamic aperture is large enough to allow off-axis injection. The alignment and stability tolerances, though challenging, are achievable. A ring with all these properties is only possible because of several major advances in mitigating the effects of nonlinear resonances. ? 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The coupling impedance of beam tubes is a long-standing important topic for particle accelerators that many authors have addressed. The present study was initiated in view of a specific problem, but its novel approach is broadly applicable to the longitudinal and transverse coupling impedances of coated beam tubes or multilayer tubes. The matrix method presented here derives the wall impedance by treating the radial wave propagation of the beam-excited electromagnetic fields in full analogy to longitudinal transmission lines. Starting from the Maxwell equations, the radially transverse magnetic field compo- nents are described for monopole and dipole modes by a 22 matrix. Assuming isotropic material properties within one layer, the transverse field components at the inner boundary of a layer uniquely are determined by matrix transfer of the field components at its outer boundary. By imposing power-flow constraints on the matrix, wave impedance mapping and field matching between layers is enforced and replaced by matrix multiplication. The longitudinal and transverse coupling impedances are derived from the wall impedance at the innermost boundary, and the different procedures for its determination are discussed. The matrix method is demonstrated via selected yet representative examples of the well-documented cases of a stainless-steel tube, and of a graphite collimator.},

abstract = {The transverse electromagnetic coupling of bunches of particles with each other is investigated theoretically, and shown to incorporate the possibility (due to the effect of imperfectly conducting vacuum chamber walls) of coherent instability even when the longitudinal distance between bunches is much larger than the transverse di- mensions of the vacuum tank. The modes of oscillation in which the bunches move rigidly are investigated; criteria for stability, and expressions for the small amplitude growth rates under unstable conditions are presented. The case of a single bunch is considered in detail and demonstrated to be stable (even in the absence of Landau damp- ing) provided p lies between an integer and the next higher half-integer, where p is the number of transverse free betatron oscillations occurring in one revolution; for many bunches which are sensibly different in intensity (a criterion for this is presented), all modes are stable provided p satisfies the same restriction. For equally spaced bunches of equal numbers of particles, approximately half the modes are unstable without Landau damping. Nu- merical examples are presented covering some intermediate situations.},

The method is based on measuring of a closed orbit deviation caused by local impedance. Transverse impedance acts on the beam as a defocusing quadrupole, strength of which depends on the beam current. If a local bump of closed orbit has been created at the impedance location, then the orbit deviation occurs while varying the beam current. The local impedance can be evaluated using the orbit deviation measured. Measurement technique is described, the method accuracy is evaluated. The method described was successfully used for measurement of the impedance distribution along the VEPP-4M storage ring.},

abstract = {The SPring-8 upgrade project has adopted the hybrid MBA lattice to achieve the emittance of about 100 pmrad at 6 GeV. This optics has two dispersion bumps in a unit cell where chromaticity-correcting sextupoles locate. The hor- izontal and vertical betatron phases between these bumps are tuned to be about 3$\pi$ and $\pi$, respectively, to cancel the loworder contributionsof nonlinearkicks due to sextupoles. However, it is not easy to obtain a sufficiently large dynamic aperture (DA) since (i) the cancellation is incomplete due to a nested arrangement, (ii) sextupoles are very strong, and (iii) the number of tuning knobs is limited. The DA is quite small due to the leakage of nonlinear kicks by nested sex- tupoles. We hence proposed to install additional weak sex- tupoles between the dispersion bumps to suppress the leak- age kick further. Simulations show that this simple scheme is very effective for suppressing amplitude-dependent tune shift (ADTS) and for enlarging DA.},

abstract = {Multibunch instabilities of a storage ring electron beam occur due to coherent particle oscillations generated through a bunch to bunch coupling via the impedances, deteriorating the beam quality. One cure for multibunch instabilities is Landau damping, i.e., introducing a spread in the oscillation frequencies among the particles of the individual bunches in order to destroy the coherence of the coupled multibunch oscillation. Measurements at ELETTRA have shown that the harmonic sextupole provides Landau damping capable of suppressing transverse multibunch instabilities. The damping is induced by the nonlinear tune spread with amplitude among the electrons within the individual bunches. {\textcopyright} 2003 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {-- In this paper we find the short range resistive wall wakefields of a point particle in a cylindrical tube, both for a dc model of conductivity and for an ac model. The distance scale SO depends on the radius of the tube and on the conductivity of the metal walls, and in typical structures is on the order of tens of microns. For both ac and dc models the short range wakefield is found to be well approximated by a simple, high frequency resonator wakefield. For the dc model of conductivity the frequency of the resonance is given by w/c = fi/ so and the Q-factor equals a/2. We provide a physical model to explain these results. For the ac model of conduc- tivity the resonance frequency depends also on the relaxation time of the metal 7. For large cr/so the frequency becomes w/c = dm, with oP the plasma frequency of the metal and b the tube radius, and the Q-factor becomes large. Finally we obtain the wakefields of a short Gaussian bunch, and then calculate the loss factor. From our results we find that, even for short bunches, the loss factor for the ac model is only slightly larger than that for the dc model.},

abstract = {The fast head-tail instability with space charge is studied using series expansion techniques, numerical simulations, and a new formulation which allows for precise estimates of growth rates and thresholds. In regimes where they are reliable, all three techniques predict that space charge suppresses the fast head-tail instability. It is found that the series expansion techniques are unreliable for parameter regimes commonly employed in hadron accelerators. The numerical techniques are less prone to error, but the computational requirements become severe as space charge tune shifts increase. The new model has neither of these problems, but it underestimates the benefits of chromaticity, at least in its simplest form.},

With the advent of storage ring sources capable of being diffraction-limited (down to a certain wavelength), advances in detector speed, dynamic range and functionality is required. While many of these improvements in detector capabilities are being pursued now, the orders-of-magnitude increases in brightness of diffraction-limited storage ring sources will require challenging non-incremental advances in detectors. This article summarizes the current state of the art, developments underway worldwide, and challenges that diffraction-limited storage ring sources present for detectors.},

In this paper, we will show how to apply the Laguerre polynomials in an analysis of this stability that are associated with the potential-well distortion. Our approach provides an alternative to the discretization method proposed by Oide and Yokoya. Moreover, it reestablishes an essential connection to the theory of mode coupling originated by Sacherer.

abstract = {Storing particles inside an electron-positron collider brings about the need for low pressures to reduce interactions with residual gas molecules. In order to provide electron beams with a lifetime of 20 h, an average pressure of about 3 x 10 -9 Torr is needed for the Large Electron Positron Collider (LEP), the construction of which has started in the proximity of CERN. Maintaining such a low pressure in spite of the small chamber cross-section and of the large degassing induced by synchrotron light requires an evenly distributed pumping speed. Traditionally, the problem is solved by means of integrated sputter ion pumps which are inserted all along the vacuum chamber and which make use of the field of the bending magnets. More recently a different linear pump, based on the use of a non-evaporable getter (NEG), was proposed. Laboratory measurements as well as real testing in an existing e+e - collider (PETRA at DESY), showed the feasibility and the advantages of this solution. The results which lead to the choice of NEG as main pump for LEP are presented and discussed.},

@article{Laslett1965,
abstract = {The transverse electromagnetic interaction of an intense azimuthally uniform beam of particles with itself, including the effect of a resistive vacuum tank, is investigated theoretically. It is shown that a beam of particles all having velocity v is unstable against the development of transverse waves having a phase velocity close to (1-v/n)v, where v is the number of transverse free betatron oscillations occurring in one revolution and n is a positive integer greater than v. The growth rate for the instability is proportional to N jut, where N is the number of particles in the beam and u is the conductivity of the surface material of the vacuum tank. Stabilizing mechanisms are examined by means of the Vlasov equatIon and it is shown that a spread in the quantity (n-v)v, evaluated for particles in the unperturbed beam, will prevent the instability. A criterion for the spread required is shown, in the limit of walls at high conductivity, to depend upon the beam intensity and energy as well as upon certain geometrical properties of the accelerator, but not upon the conductivity. Numerical examples covering a range of particle accelerators are presented, and suggest that the theory is in agreement with the coherent beam behavior recently observed in a number of accelerators.},

abstract = {A method is presented for determining the stability of a system consisting of several highly relativistic bunches of charged particles circulating in a storage ring. The particles interact with magnets designed to guide the beam as well as with electromagnetic fields induced by the particles themselves. Previous work has considered modes where all bunches in the ring are executing the same type of internal oscillation. This dissertation considers the results of allowing those modes to couple to one another. The formalism begins with a self- consistent distribution, and analyzes small perturbations to that distribution to determine if they grow exponentially. The formalism allows one to do this computation for an arbitrary magnetic lattice, as well as an arbitrary distribution of wakefield sources around the ring. The method also allows for the inclusion of a feedback system which is designed to damp multibunch oscillations. The PEP-II B-factory with a linear lattice is used as an example to demonstrate and explain the phenomenology that results from this coupling of multibunch modes. The effect of adding feedback is also explored.},

The three highest ener- gy, highest brightness light sources are ESRF, APS, and SPring-8. Maintaining high performance in these sources is a primary goal, as is understanding limitations due to the coupling impedance and beam instabilities. A series of studies, both experimental and theoretical, have been carried out independently at each facility. The similarity of the machines and user requirements provided the moti- vation to compare the characteristics of the three rings.},

abstract = {The effect of finite resistance in the vacuum-tank walls on the longitudinal stability of an intense beam of particles in an accelerator is investigated theoretically. We show that even if the particle frequency is an increasing function of particle energy, the wall resistance can render the beam unstable against longitudinal bunching. In the absence of frequency spread in the unperturbed beam, the instability occurs with a growth rate that is proportional to (N /u)t, where N is the number of particles in the beam and u is the conductivity of the surface material. By means of the Vlasov equation a criterion for beam stability is obtained. In the limit of highly conducting walls the criterion involves the frequency spread in the unperturbed beam, the number of particles N, the beam energy, geometrical properties of the accelerator, but not the conductivity u. A numerical example presented indicates that certain observations of beam behavior in the MURA 40 MeV electron accelerator may be related to the phenomenon we investigated.},

In particular, the perturbations due to magnetic sextupoles have been calculated to second power in the sextupole strength. The frequency spectra for the horizontal and the vertical betatron motion close to a single resonance have been calculated using time-independent perturbation theory. It has been shown that information about excited resonances and the type of driving field can be derived from the spectra. In particular, it is possible to obtain the amplitude and the phase of a given resonance. The results have been used to study the perturbations in the Low Energy Antiproton Ring (LEAR) at CERN.},

abstract = {A method is presented for determining the stability of a system consisting of several highly relativistic bunches of charged particles circulating in a storage ring. The particles interact with magnets designed to guide the beam as well as with electromagnetic fields induced by the particles themselves. Previous work has considered modes where all bunches in the ring are executing the same type of internal oscillation. This dissertation considers the results of allowing those modes to couple to one another. The formalism begins with a self- consistent distribution, and analyzes small perturbations to that distribution to determine if they grow exponentially. The formalism allows one to do this computation for an arbitrary magnetic lattice, as well as an arbitrary distribution of wakefield sources around the ring. The method also allows for the inclusion of a feedback system which is designed to damp multibunch oscillations. The PEP-II B-factory with a linear lattice is used as an example to demonstrate and explain the phenomenology that results from this coupling of multibunch modes. The effect of adding feedback is also explored.},

abstract = {In this paper we develop a newmethod, using the parabolic equation (PE), for the calculation of both high-frequency and small-angle taper (or collimator) impedances. The applicability of the PE in the high-frequency limit is based on the observation that in this case the contribution to impedance comes from the electromagneticwaves that catch up with the beam far from the obstacle and propagate at small angles to the axis of the pipe. One of the most important advantages of the PE is that it eliminates the spatial scale of the smallwavelength from the problem. As a result, the numerical solution of the PE requires coarser spatial meshes. In this paper we focus on the longitudinal impedance for an axisymmetric geometry and assume a perfect conductivity of the walls.We show how the known analytical results which include a small-angle collimator, step-in and step-out transitions, and a pillbox cavity, can be derived within the framework of the PE.},

The course consisted of lectures in the mornings covering fundamental background knowledge in mathematics, controls theory, design tools, programming hardware platforms, and implementation details. In the afternoons the students split into two groups with people working in pairs. One group worked on problem solving using a PC-based workstation connected to a DSP evaluation board. Half-way through the school, those working on SDPs moved to FPGAs and vice versa. The problems to be solved were of increasing difficulty and all of them were directly related to real and practical realizations currently in use in the accelerator field.},

abstract = {My intention in this book is to provide some understanding of the various methods that have been proposed for treating time-dependent processes in statistical mechanics. Some familiarity with equilibrium statistical mechanics is assumed. Whenever possible, I start with a simple example, generalize it, and finally discuss its theoretical foun- dations. The applications treated here were chosen as simple illustra- tions of a particular method; these choices were motivated by their utility in chemical physics. The methods, of course, have a much wider applicability, for example, in biophysics or condensed matter physics or even in astrophysics. There are no problem sets or exercises; most inter- esting problems are suitable subjects for serious research, and there is no point practicing on uninteresting problems. There are few literature references, only the occasional name and date; a lot of the material has been around a long time, and some of it is my own work. In a letter accepting the Rumford medal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1881, J. Willard Gibbs wrote One of the principal objects of theoretical research in any department of knowledge is to find the point of view from which the subject appears in its greatest simplicity. This is a hard standard; I hope that I came close. I am especially indebted to Attila Szabo, who encouraged me to finish a project I started about 1965 and who worked hard to get me to simplify my often obscure treat- ments of various topics.

It relies on expressing the wake potentials, of any multipole order, as integrals over the e.m. fields along an arbitrary one-dimensional contour spanning the structure longitudinally. For perfectly conducting structures, the integration along the axis can then be replaced by choosing a contour beginning and ending on the beam tubes. Thus it generalizes the former method of calculating the wake potentials by integrating along a straight line at the beam tube radius. Its usefulness is illustrated with the computer code ABCI which permits calculation of wake potentials in structures extending to the inside of the beam tube radius, or having unequal beam tube radii at the two sides. ?? 1993.},

abstract = {In positron and proton storage rings, electrons produced by photoemission, ionization, and secondary emis- sion accumulate in the vacuum chamber during multibunch operation with close spacing. A positron or proton bunch passing through this ‘‘electron cloud'' experiences a force similar to a short-range wake field. This effective wake field can cause a transverse-mode-coupling instability, if the electron-cloud density exceeds a threshold value. In this report, we compute the electron-cloud induced wake in a region without external magnetic field both analytically and via computer simulation, for parameters representing the low-energy positron ring of KEKB and the LHC proton beam in the CERN SPS. We study the linearity and time dependence of the wake function and its variation with the size of the electron cloud. Using a broadband resonator model for the electron-cloud wake field, we then evaluate theoretical expressions for the transverse- mode-coupling instability based on the linearized Vlasov equation, and for the instability threshold of fast transverse blow up including its dependence on chromaticity.},

We then show that various predictions of the theory agree quite well with results from particle tracking simulations, including the threshold current for transverse instability and the profile of the unstable mode. In particular, we find that predicting collective stability for high energy electron beams at moderate to large values of chromaticity requires the full Fokker- Planck analysis to properly account for the effects of damping and diffusion due to synchrotron radiation.},

abstract = {The resistive wall impedance of cylindrical vacuum chambers was first calculated over 40 years ago. The original results were valid for metal vacuum chamber walls which are thick compared to the skin depth at the frequencies of interest. Recently the subject has again become important for beam stability in the LHC where in particular the transverse impedance of the large number of graphite collimators to be installed could severely limit its performance, if the “thick wall” formulae were correct. The frequencies of the slow betatron waves in such a large machine are very low and thus the transverse impedance, originally found to be proportional to the inverse square root of frequency, could lead to instabilities. However, when the skin depth exceeds the wall thickness, the transverse resistive wall impedance is strongly reduced and a number of papers have recently been published to estimate this reduction. However, all of these had restrictions of validity. Here we give a consistent derivation of the general expression for the transverse impedance of walls made of arbitrary materials which are valid at all frequencies. The results are compared with previous ones in the graphs for the LHC collimators - where they agree quite well, but also for the SPS-MKE kickers which are required for injection into the LHC and where the agreement is less perfect.},

Both rings make use of a 100 MHz RF system and are designed to operate with a uniform multibunch fill pattern aswell as employ passive harmonic cavities to damp instabilities and increase Touschek lifetime. Recently, a discussion on timing modes at the MAX IV storage rings has been initiated by the user community. This implies operating the rings with other fill patterns than the originally planned multibunch mode and therefore detailed studies of the performance of the harmonic cavities are of interest. This paper presents bunch length measurements at the 100 MHz MAX II storage ring for uniform fill patterns. The purpose of the measurements was to evaluate the employed measurement method and simulation codes for future studies of fill patterns in the MAX IV storage rings.},

@inproceedings{Neuenschwander2015,
abstract = {We review some of the present engineering challenges associated with the design and construction of ultra-low emittance storage rings, the 4th generation storage rings (4GSR). The field is experiencing a growing interest since MAX-IV, followed by Sirius, started to build storage rings based on multi-bend-achromat (MBA) lattices. It was the recent progress in accelerator technology that allowed these facilities to base their designs on this kind of lattice. Although the challenges are starting to be overcome, many issues are still open and a lot of R{\&}D is required until the 4GSR achieve optimal performance.},

An overview is presented of the design approaches for these 4th generation storage ring (4GSR) light sources now in construction or being studied for near-term implementation, together with concepts for future rings that would operate with emittances at or below the diffraction limit for 1-{\AA} (12-keV).},
