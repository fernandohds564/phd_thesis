abstract = {xperimental x-ray techniques that benefit from the great increase in brightness and coherent flux prov ided by the fourth generation of synchrotron light sources, based on recent advances in accelerator design and techno logy, are widely expanding nowadays. The basic ingredient to higher brightness is a further reduction of the electron beam emittance in storage rings dedicated to light sources. However , to fully explore the potential of these new sources, it is necessary to optimize other vari ables as well, such as the proper matching of electrons and photons phase - space and the possibility of using new kinds of insertion devices. Equally important is to try new ways to improve the integration between the light s ource capabilities and the experiment needs. In this work , recent progress of low emittance rings will be reviewed an d the efforts to improve transverse coherent flux and sou rce - to - beamline integration at the Brazilian Sirius project will be described.},

abstract = {We present the multibunch tracking code mbtrack developed to simulate, in 6-dimensional phase space, single- and multibunch collective instabilities driven by short- and long-range wakefields in storage rings. Multiple bunches, each composed of a large number of macroparticles, are tracked, allowing simulation of both intra- and interbunch motions. Besides analytical impedance models, the code allows employment of numerical wake potentials computed with electromagnetic (EM) field solvers. The corresponding impedances are fitted to a number of known analytical functions and the coefficients obtained in the fit are used as an input to the code. mbtrack performs a dynamic treatment of long-range resistive-wall and harmonic cavity fields, which are likely to be the two major factors impacting multibunch collective motions in many present and future ring-based light sources. Furthermore, it is capable of simulating beam-ion interactions as well as transverse bunch-by-bunch feedback. We describe the physical effects considered in the code and their implementation, which makes use of parallel processing to significantly shorten the computation time. mbtrack is benchmarked against other codes and applied to the MAX IV 3GeV ring as an example, where the importance of the interplay of various physical effects as well as coupling among different degrees of freedom is demonstrated.},

The course was held in Sigtuna, Sweden, from 1 May - 9 June 2007.this is the first time this topic has been selected for a specialized course. Taking into account the number of related applications currently in use in accelerators around the world, it was recognized that such a topic should definitevely be incorporated into the CAS serires of specialized courses. the specific aim of the course was to introduce the participants to the use and programming of Digital Signal processors (DSPs) an Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) evaluation board. The course consisted of lectures in the mornings covering fundamental background knowledge in mathematics, controls theory, design tools, programming hardware platforms, and implementation details. In the afternoons the students split into two groups with people working in pairs. One group worked on problem solving using a PC-based workstation connected to a DSP evaluation board. Half-way through the school, those working on SDPs moved to FPGAs and vice versa. The problems to be solved were of increasing difficulty and all of them were directly related to real and practical realizations currently in use in the accelerator field.},

For shielded CSR we show that only two dimensionless parameters, the shielding parameter  and the strength parameter Scsr, are needed to describe the system. We further show that there is a strong instability associated with CSR, and that the threshold, to good approximation, is given by ðScsrÞth ¼ 0:5þ0:12. In particular, this means that shielding has little effect in stabilizing the beam for  {\&} 2; for larger  it is effective, with threshold current depending on shielding aperture as h3=2.We, in addition, find another instability in the vicinity of  ¼ 0:7 with a lower threshold, ðScsrÞth  0:2. We find that the threshold to this instability depends strongly on damping time, ðScsrÞth 1=2 p , and that the tune spread at threshold is small—both hallmarks of a weak instability.},

abstract = {The NSLS-II storage ring is designed to operate with superconducting RF-cavities with the aim to store an average current of 500 mA distributed in 1080 bunches, with a gap in the uniform filling for ion clearing. At the early stage of the commissioning (phase 1), characterized by a bare lattice without damping wigglers and without Landau cavities, a normal conducting 7-cell PETRA-III RF-cavity structure has been installed with the goal to store an average current of 25 mA. In this paper we discuss our analysis of coupled-bunch instabilities driven by the Higher Order Modes (HOMs) of the 7-cell PETRA-III RF-cavity. As a cure of the instabilities, we apply a well-known scheme based on a proper detuning of the HOMs frequencies based upon cavity temperature change, and the use of the beneficial effect of the slow head-tail damping at positive chromaticity to increase the transverse coupled-bunch instability thresholds. In addition, we discuss measurements of coupled-bunch instabilities observed during the phase 1 commissioning of the NSLS-II storage ring. In our analysis we rely, in the longitudinal case, on the theory of coupled-bunch instability for uniform fillings, while in the transverse case we complement our studies with numerical simulations with OASIS, a novel parallel particle tracking code for self-consistent simulations of collective effects driven by short and long-range wakefields.},

abstract = {High-power, pulsed, coherent, far-infrared (FIR) radiation has many scientific applications, such as pump-probe studies of surfaces, liquids, and solids, studies of high-Tc, superconductors, biophysics, plasma diagnostics, and excitation of Rydberg atoms. Few sources of such FIR radiation currently exist. Superradiant undulator radiation produced at the SUNSHINE (Stanford UNiversity SHort INtense Electron-source) is such a FIR source. First proposed in the mm-wave spectral range by Motz, superradiant undulator radiation has been realized in the 45 um to 300 um spectral range by using sub-picosecond electron bunches produced by the SUNSHINE facility. The experimental setup and measurements of this FIR radiation are reported in this thesis. In addition to being a useful FIR source, the superradiant undulator radiation produced at SUNSHINE is an object of research in itself. Measured superlinear growth of the radiated energy along the undulator demonstrates the self-amplification of radiation by the electron bunch. This superlinear growth is seen at 47 um to 70 um wavelengths. These wavelengths are an order of magnitude shorter than in previous self-amplification demonstrations.},

Passive harmonic cavities are intro- duced to relax the Touschek-lifetime and intrabeam scat- tering issues as well as ?ght collective beam instabilities via Landau damping. Since instabilities occur during in- jection, when the passive harmonic cavity potential is also time varying, it became important to simulate this transient process. The most promising approach was considered to be multibunch tracking which also allows for an arbitrary ?lling pattern. Since every bunch is represented by nu- merous macro-particles, internalmotions as well as micro- structures in the charge distribution can be followed.},

abstract = {this thesis is to design and optimize the RF-gun to achieve electron bunch length in femtosecond scale. Starting from the Stanford SUNSHINE design, the RF-gun has been optimized and constructed. These studies were performed by numerical simulation using the codes SUPERFISH and PARMELA. Systematic simulation studies were carried out to investigate the fundamental and practical limits in reducing the electron bunch length. The numerical studies include bunch length dispersion due to focusing in the transport system leading to a final bunch length of some 53 fs with a bunch charge of 94 pCb giving a peak current of 707 A. The RF-gun was constructed based on simulation results. Low-power RF measurements were performed and the results shows that the resonant frequency of the RF-gun is 2855.3 MHz at 25oC in ambient air, which can be tuned to 2856 MHz by adjusting the RF-gun temperature, and the quality factor is 12979 with the RF-coupling coefficient of about 7.5. The RF-gun and other components have been installed at the SURIYA project. The experimental results show that the electron beam of 2-2.5 MeV maximum kinetic energy and a beam current up to 1 A can be obtained from the RF-gun with input power of 3.65 MW. Electron bunches as short as 53 fs can be converted into broad band co- herent radiation in the high-intensity far-infrared (FIR) regime at wavelengths of 50-1000 µm. To verify the simulation results, a transition radiation experimental station to produce FIR transition radiation has been installed. Recently, the FIR signal from transition radiation was successfully observed and verified for the first time at SURIYA laboratory by using room temperature pyroelectric detector.},

A Hamiltonian formalism, expanded to third order in the canonical variables, has also been developed to describe the transverse motion in an accelerator. Time-dependent perturbation theory has been applied and computerized using a computer-algebra system. In particular, the perturbations due to magnetic sextupoles have been calculated to second power in the sextupole strength. The frequency spectra for the horizontal and the vertical betatron motion close to a single resonance have been calculated using time-independent perturbation theory. It has been shown that information about excited resonances and the type of driving field can be derived from the spectra. In particular, it is possible to obtain the amplitude and the phase of a given resonance. The results have been used to study the perturbations in the Low Energy Antiproton Ring (LEAR) at CERN.},

Few sources of such FIR radiation currently exist. Superradiant undulator radiation produced at the SUNSHINE (Stanford UNiversity SHort INtense Electron-source) is such a FIR source. First proposed in the mm-wave spectral range by Motz, superradiant undulator radiation has been realized in the 45 um to 300 um spectral range by using sub-picosecond electron bunches produced by the SUNSHINE facility. The experimental setup and measurements of this FIR radiation are reported in this thesis. In addition to being a useful FIR source, the superradiant undulator radiation produced at SUNSHINE is an object of research in itself. Measured superlinear growth of the radiated energy along the undulator demonstrates the self-amplification of radiation by the electron bunch. This superlinear growth is seen at 47 um to 70 um wavelengths. These wavelengths are an order of magnitude shorter than in previous self-amplification demonstrations.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a new two particle model for studying the strong head-tail instabilities in the presence of the space-charge force. It is a simple expansion of the well-known two particle model for strong head-tail instability and is still analytically solvable. No chromaticity effect is included. It leads to a formula for the growth rate as a function of the two dimensionless parameters: the space-charge tune shift parameter (normalized by the synchrotron tune) and the wakefield strength, ϒ. The three-dimensional contour plot of the growth rate as a function of those two dimensionless parameters reveals stopband structures. Many simulation results generally indicate that a strong head-tail instability can be damped by a weak space- charge force, but the beam becomes unstable again when the space-charge force is further increased. The newtwo particle model indicates a similar behavior. In weak space-charge regions, additional tune shifts by the space-charge force dissolve the mode coupling. As the space-charge force is increased, they conversely restore the mode coupling, but then a further increase of the space-charge force decouples the modes again. This mode coupling/decoupling behavior creates the stopband structures.},

A feedback system has been developed, installed and commissioned at the VEPP-4M electron-positron collider. An original scheme of the kicker powering has been developed to provide the necessary performance with minimal expenses. Real-time digital data processing performed by a code running in an FPGA module provides high efficiency and flexibility of the system.

The facility is comprised of two storage rings optimized for different wavelength ranges, a linac-based short-pulse facility and a free- electron laser for the production of coherent radiation. The main radiation source of MAX IV will be a 528multralow emittance storage ring operated at 3 GeV for the generation of high-brightness hard x rays. This storage ring was designed to meet the requirements of state-of-the-art insertion devices which will be installed in nineteen 5 m long dispersion-free straight sections. The storage ring is based on a novel multibend achromat design delivering an unprecedented horizontal bare lattice emittance of 0.33 nm rad and a vertical emittance below the 8 pmrad diffraction limit for 1 A ˚ radiation. In this paper we present the beam dynamics considerations behind this storage-ring design and detail its expected unique performance.},

The effect of electron cloud and/or a conventional impedance (resonator or resis- tive wall) on a single bunch is modeled using a wake field approach. The code naturally allows either for dedicated studies of one single effect or for more complex studies of the interplay between different effects. Sample results from electron cloud studies on coherent ef- fects as well as TMCI and coherent tune shift studies will be discussed and compared with results from other codes having similar features and/or with existing machine data.},

abstract = {A new method for measurement of transverse couple impedance distribution along storage ring is described. The method is based on measuring of a closed orbit deviation caused by local impedance. Transverse impedance acts on the beam as a defocusing quadrupole, strength of which depends on the beam current. If a local bump of closed orbit has been created at the impedance location, then the orbit deviation occurs while varying the beam current. The local impedance can be evaluated using the orbit deviation measured. Measurement technique is described, the method accuracy is evaluated. The method described was successfully used for measurement of the impedance distribution along the VEPP-4M storage ring.},

These requirements may be dficult to achieve simultaneously, lmding the designer into interesting opportunities for optimimtion or compromise. Some usefil techniques and tools are shown. Both finite element analysis and analytic techniques will be used to investigate quasi-static aspects of electromagnetic fields such as the impedance of and the coupling of beam to striplines or buttons. Finite*lement tools will be used to understand dynamic aspects of the electromagnetic fields of beams, such as w{\~{}}efields and transmission-line and cavity effects in vacuum-to-air Feedthroughs. Mathematical modeling of eleetricd signals through a processing chain will be demonstrated, in particular to illuminate areas where neither a pure timedomain nor a pure frequencydomain analysis is obviously advantageous.

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a time-frequency representation where the frequency bins are distributed uniformly in log-frequency and their Q-factors obey a linear function of the bin center frequencies. The latter allows for time-frequency representations where the bandwidths can be e.g. constant on the log-frequency scale (constant Q) or constant on the auditory critical-band scale (smoothly varying Q). The proposed techniques are published as a Matlab toolbox that extends [3]. Besides the features that stem from [3] – perfect reconstruction and computational efficiency – we propose here a technique for computing coefficient phases in a way that makes their interpretation more natural. Other extensions include flexible control of the Q-values and more regular sampling of the time-frequency plane in order to simplify signal processing in the transform domain.},

@article{Qin2014,
abstract = {The dynamics of charged particles in general linear focusing lattices with quadrupole, skew-quadrupole, dipole, and solenoidal components, as well as torsion of the fiducial orbit and variation of beam energy is parametrized using a generalized Courant-Snyder (CS) theory, which extends the original CS theory for one degree of freedom to higher dimensions. The envelope function is generalized into an envelope matrix, and the phase advance is generalized into a 4D symplectic rotation, or a Uð2Þ element. The 1D envelope equation, also known as the Ermakov-Milne-Pinney equation in quantum mechanics, is generalized to an envelope matrix equation in higher dimensions. Other components of the original CS theory, such as the transfer matrix, Twiss functions, and CS invariant (also known as the Lewis invariant) all have their counterparts, with remarkably similar expressions, in the generalized theory. The gauge group structure of the generalized theory is analyzed. By fixing the gauge freedom with a desired symmetry, the generalized CS parametrization assumes the form of the modified Iwasawa decomposition, whose importance in phase space optics and phase space quantum mechanics has been recently realized. This gauge fixing also symmetrizes the generalized envelope equation and expresses the theory using only the generalized Twiss function {\$}\beta{\$}. The generalized phase advance completely determines the spectral and structural stability properties of a general focusing lattice. For structural stability, the generalized CS theory enables application of the Krein-Moser theory to greatly simplify the stability analysis. The generalized CS theory provides an effective tool to study coupled dynamics and to discover more optimized lattice designs in the larger parameter space of general focusing lattices.},

The procedure is significantly more efficient computationally than the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) for transforming functions or measured responses which decay slowly with increasing abscissa value. We illustrate the proposed method with an example from electromagnetic geophysics, where the scaling is often such that our logarithmic Fourier transform (LFT) should be applied. For the example chosen, we are able to obtain results that agree with those from an FFT to within 0.5 per cent in a time that is a factor of 10� shorter. Potential applications of our LFT in geophysics include conversion of wide-band electromagnetic frequency responses to transient responses, glacial loading and unloading, aquifer recharge problems, normal mode and earth tide studies in seismology, and impulsive shock wave modelling.},

The convergence of the expansion is confirmed by computer calculation to be very rapid. Compared with the Vlasov equation treatment, the threshold of transverse mode-coupling instability in PEP, PETRA, and TRISTAN is shown to be somewhat lowered, owing to radiation effects. Dipole oscillations are excited before the eigenfrequencies of two modes (m = 0 and m = -1) meet. It is also shown that when the Vlasov equation is used to study the coupled-bunch instability an approximate stability criterion is that the growth rate should be less than 1/t'{\~{}} + Iml/t's' where t'{\~{}} and t's are radiation damping times for betatron and synchrotron oscillations, respectively, and m is the azimuthal mode number. Higher radial modes are damped more strongly.},

abstract = {The Advanced Photon Source storage ring has a number of narrow-gap insertion device vacuum chambers, and there is a plan to further increase their number. These vacuum chambers contribute to the impedance of the machine and to the impedance limits the single-bunch current threshold. In order to understand the contribution of the vacuum chambers and its dependence on the gap, the distribution of the vertical transverse impedance around the circumference of the APS storage ring has been determined using the response matrix fit method. This method allows us to find focusing errors around the storage ring and was originally used to determine and correct the linear model of the APS. The high accuracy of the method enables us to measure the variation of betatron phase advance around the ring with beam current. Results of these measurements are reported and the impedance of different parts of the storage ring is presented.},

abstract = {A fast transverse single bunch instability has been observed and has restricted the stored currents in several storage rings, e.g. PEP and PETRA. This paper describes a method, which is the generalization of Sacherer's theory without mode couplings, to analyze the fast transverse instability in a Gaussian bunch. This method includes the radial modes and requires negative azimuthal modes. It makes clear that the fast instability in PEP and PETRA is caused by the mode coupling between the azimuthal modes m = 0 and m = -1, and that its growth rate rises very rapidly above the threshold. The method also predicts that the threshold current could not be improved by a large factor even if the bunch length is increased to several centimeters. The TRISTAN threshold current estimated by scaling from the PEP experimental data is about 3.5 mA per bunch for the worst case. ?? 1983.},

@phdthesis{Rimjaem2006,
abstract = {this thesis is to design and optimize the RF-gun to achieve electron bunch length in femtosecond scale. Starting from the Stanford SUNSHINE design, the RF-gun has been optimized and constructed. These studies were performed by numerical simulation using the codes SUPERFISH and PARMELA. Systematic simulation studies were carried out to investigate the fundamental and practical limits in reducing the electron bunch length. The numerical studies include bunch length dispersion due to focusing in the transport system leading to a final bunch length of some 53 fs with a bunch charge of 94 pCb giving a peak current of 707 A. The RF-gun was constructed based on simulation results. Low-power RF measurements were performed and the results shows that the resonant frequency of the RF-gun is 2855.3 MHz at 25oC in ambient air, which can be tuned to 2856 MHz by adjusting the RF-gun temperature, and the quality factor is 12979 with the RF-coupling coefficient of about 7.5. The RF-gun and other components have been installed at the SURIYA project. The experimental results show that the electron beam of 2-2.5 MeV maximum kinetic energy and a beam current up to 1 A can be obtained from the RF-gun with input power of 3.65 MW. Electron bunches as short as 53 fs can be converted into broad band co- herent radiation in the high-intensity far-infrared (FIR) regime at wavelengths of 50-1000 µm. To verify the simulation results, a transition radiation experimental station to produce FIR transition radiation has been installed. Recently, the FIR signal from transition radiation was successfully observed and verified for the first time at SURIYA laboratory by using room temperature pyroelectric detector.},

abstract = {We present an exact and analytical expression for the Fourier transform of a function that has been sampled logarithmically. The procedure is significantly more efficient computationally than the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) for transforming functions or measured responses which decay slowly with increasing abscissa value. We illustrate the proposed method with an example from electromagnetic geophysics, where the scaling is often such that our logarithmic Fourier transform (LFT) should be applied. For the example chosen, we are able to obtain results that agree with those from an FFT to within 0.5 per cent in a time that is a factor of 10� shorter. Potential applications of our LFT in geophysics include conversion of wide-band electromagnetic frequency responses to transient responses, glacial loading and unloading, aquifer recharge problems, normal mode and earth tide studies in seismology, and impulsive shock wave modelling.},

Yet, how to accurately determine this threshold, above which the Haissinski distribution becomes unstable, is not firmly established in theory. In this paper, we will show how to apply the Laguerre polynomials in an analysis of this stability that are associated with the potential-well distortion. Our approach provides an alternative to the discretization method proposed by Oide and Yokoya. Moreover, it reestablishes an essential connection to the theory of mode coupling originated by Sacherer. Our new and self-consistent method is applied to study the microwave instability driven by commonly known impedances, including coherent synchrotron radiation in free space.},

abstract = {Injection into the two MAX IV storage rings will not make use of a 4-kicker local injection bump. Instead, pulsed multipole injection will be used for initial filling as well as top-up injection. Since commissioning a pulsed multipole magnet for injection into a storage ring is non-trivial, it has been decided to install a single dipole kicker magnet into the storage rings to provide a simple method for injection during early commissioning. Design studies have revealed that injection with a single dipole kicker into the MAX IV storage rings is not only efficient, but also allows for accumulation of beam. Although this accumulation cannot be made transparent to users (i.e. it is not compatible with user top-up operation), it does provide a simple and robust injection method during commissioning. In addition, the dipole kicker can be used as a pinger magnet during machine studies with a single-bunch filling. This paper reports on the design studies performed for dipole kicker injection into the MAX IV storage rings and presents a summary of the expected performance of such an injection scheme. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The convergence of the expansion is confirmed by computer calculation to be very rapid. The Robinson instability occurs for sharply peaked impedance. Calculation shows that a simplified approach based on the Vlasov equation can be taken when combined with an approximate stability criterion that the growth rate should be less than Imllt, where m is the azimuthal mode number and t is the radiation damping time for synchrotron oscillations. Fast instability occurs when coupling between different azimuthal modes is taken into account. The threshold of this instability calculated by the Fokker-Planck equation is almost equal to that obtained by the Vlasov equation. Thus radiation effects are shown to play little role in fast instability.},

These vacuum chambers contribute to the impedance of the machine and to the impedance limits the single-bunch current threshold. In order to understand the contribution of the vacuum chambers and its dependence on the gap, the distribution of the vertical transverse impedance around the circumference of the APS storage ring has been determined using the response matrix fit method. This method allows us to find focusing errors around the storage ring and was originally used to determine and correct the linear model of the APS. The high accuracy of the method enables us to measure the variation of betatron phase advance around the ring with beam current. Results of these measurements are reported and the impedance of different parts of the storage ring is presented.},

In particular, necessary and sufficient conditions for the independence of the impedance on the beam longitudinal direc- tion are given. The impedances of two basic simple structures — that of a cavity and that of a step — are studied in detail. The transition from the regime of a cavity to the regime of a step is explained, an ap- proximate formula describing this transition is given, and the criterion for determining the applicability of each regime is established. The asymptotic behavior of the impedance for a finite number Mof periodical- ly arranged cavities as a function ofM is studied. The difference in the behavior of the impedance for a single cavity and that for an infinite number of cavities is explained as the result of the interference of the diffracted waves. A criterion for determining the transition in the impedance behavior from small M to large Mis presented.},

@article{Zagorodnov2005,
abstract = {The Yee finite-difference time domain method (FDTD) is commonly used in wake field and particle-in-cell simulations. However, in accelerator modeling the high energy particles can travel in vacuum faster than their own radiation. This effect is commonly referred to as numerical Cherenkov radiation and is a consequence of numerical grid dispersion. Several numerical approaches are proposed to reduce the dispersion for all angles and for a given frequency range, that justifies itself for domains big in all three directions. On the contrary, in accelerator modeling the transverse dimensions and transverse beam velocity are small, but it is extremely important to eliminate the dispersion error in the well-defined direction of the beam motion for all frequencies. In this paper we propose a new two-level economical conservative scheme for electromagnetic field calculations in three dimensions. The scheme does not have dispersion in the longitudinal direction and is staircase-free (second order convergent). Unlike the FDTD method, it is based on a “transversal-electric/transversal-magnetic” (TE/TM)-like splitting of the field components in time. The scheme assures energy and charge conservation. Additionally, the usage of damping terms allows suppressing high frequency noise generated due to the transverse dispersion and the current fluctuations. The dispersion relation of the damping scheme is analyzed. As numerical examples show, the new scheme is much more accurate on the long-time scale than the conventional FDTD approach. },

We then show that various predictions of the theory agree quite well with results from particle tracking simulations, including the threshold current for transverse instability and the profile of the unstable mode. In particular, we find that predicting collective stability for high energy electron beams at moderate to large values of chromaticity requires the full Fokker- Planck analysis to properly account for the effects of damping and diffusion due to synchrotron radiation.},

Explicit expressions are given for the growth rate of betatron and synchrotron oscillation amplitudes on resonance and on fast-crossing of the resonance.

The theory is shown to agree fairly well with the computer simulation for PETRA and some numerical examples are given for the booster of the TRIUMF Kaon Factory project.

An equivalent instability mechanism is encountered in positron beams where ionization electrons oscillate within a single bunch. In either case, the oscillations grow exponentially with an exponent proportional to t{\^{}}1/2 . In this paper, the rise time of the instability is calculated analytically by a perturbation series approach and is compared with computer simulations. Growth rates are evaluated for several existing or proposed storage rings and linear accelerators; the effect considered could be a significant limitation in many of the future designs.},

Truncation ofthis determinant permits solution ofthe problem on a computer, and a code has been written which finds the complex mode frequencies. The stability limits are determined by equating the imaginary part of the solution to the radiation damping rate. The theory is applied to LEP at injection with third higher-harmonic cavities, and the results were compared with those obtained by the multi-particle simulation program. They show excellent agreement, and predict that the threshold current will be reduced rather than improved.},

@article{Qin2014,
abstract = {The dynamics of charged particles in general linear focusing lattices with quadrupole, skew-quadrupole, dipole, and solenoidal components, as well as torsion of the fiducial orbit and variation of beam energy is parametrized using a generalized Courant-Snyder (CS) theory, which extends the original CS theory for one degree of freedom to higher dimensions. The envelope function is generalized into an envelope matrix, and the phase advance is generalized into a 4D symplectic rotation, or a Uð2Þ element. The 1D envelope equation, also known as the Ermakov-Milne-Pinney equation in quantum mechanics, is generalized to an envelope matrix equation in higher dimensions. Other components of the original CS theory, such as the transfer matrix, Twiss functions, and CS invariant (also known as the Lewis invariant) all have their counterparts, with remarkably similar expressions, in the generalized theory. The gauge group structure of the generalized theory is analyzed. By fixing the gauge freedom with a desired symmetry, the generalized CS parametrization assumes the form of the modified Iwasawa decomposition, whose importance in phase space optics and phase space quantum mechanics has been recently realized. This gauge fixing also symmetrizes the generalized envelope equation and expresses the theory using only the generalized Twiss function $\beta$. The generalized phase advance completely determines the spectral and structural stability properties of a general focusing lattice. For structural stability, the generalized CS theory enables application of the Krein-Moser theory to greatly simplify the stability analysis. The generalized CS theory provides an effective tool to study coupled dynamics and to discover more optimized lattice designs in the larger parameter space of general focusing lattices.},

One cure for multibunch instabilities is Landau damping, i.e., introducing a spread in the oscillation frequencies among the particles of the individual bunches in order to destroy the coherence of the coupled multibunch oscillation. Measurements at ELETTRA have shown that the harmonic sextupole provides Landau damping capable of suppressing transverse multibunch instabilities. The damping is induced by the nonlinear tune spread with amplitude among the electrons within the individual bunches. {\textcopyright} 2003 The American Physical Society.},

Computer code GdfidL is used for the estimate of impedances in some of above structures. A new method for measurement of transverse coupling impedance has been used. The method is based on measuring of closed orbit deviation caused by localized impedance. Transverse impedance acts on the beam as a defocusing quadrupole, strength of which depends on the beam current. If a local bump of closed orbit has been created at the impedance location, then the orbit deviation occurs while varying the beam current. The local impedance can be evaluated using the orbit deviation measured. The results of the measurements and numerical calculations are presented and compared.},

@article{Ohmi2002,
abstract = {In positron and proton storage rings, electrons produced by photoemission, ionization, and secondary emis- sion accumulate in the vacuum chamber during multibunch operation with close spacing. A positron or proton bunch passing through this ‘‘electron cloud'' experiences a force similar to a short-range wake field. This effective wake field can cause a transverse-mode-coupling instability, if the electron-cloud density exceeds a threshold value. In this report, we compute the electron-cloud induced wake in a region without external magnetic field both analytically and via computer simulation, for parameters representing the low-energy positron ring of KEKB and the LHC proton beam in the CERN SPS. We study the linearity and time dependence of the wake function and its variation with the size of the electron cloud. Using a broadband resonator model for the electron-cloud wake field, we then evaluate theoretical expressions for the transverse- mode-coupling instability based on the linearized Vlasov equation, and for the instability threshold of fast transverse blow up including its dependence on chromaticity.},

@article{Tavares2014,
abstract = {The MAX IV storage rings, currently under construction in Lund, Sweden, will use third harmonic cavities operated passively to lengthen the bunches and alleviate collective instabilities. These cavities are an essential ingredient in the MAX IV design concept and are required for achieving the final design goals in terms of stored current, beam emittance, and beam lifetime—such performance challenges are in fact common to all recent ultralow emittance storage ring designs and harmonic cavities are currently under consideration in several laboratories. In this paper, we report on parametric studies comparing different harmonic cavity settings in terms of the resulting bunch length, peak bunch density, and incoherent synchrotron frequency spread for the MAX IV 3 GeV ring. The equilibrium longitudinal bunch density distribution was calculated by establishing a self-consistent equation for the bunch form factor, describing the bunch shape. The calculations are fully self-consistent in the sense that not only the amplitude but also the phase of the waves excited by the beam in the harmonic cavity were assumed to be a function of the bunch shape, which allowed us to explore a wide parameter range not restricted to the region close to the conditions for which the first and second derivatives of the total rf voltage are zero at the synchronous phase. Our results indicate that up to a factor 5 increase in rms bunch length is achievable with a purely passive system for theMAXIV 3 GeV ring while keeping a relatively large harmonic cavity detuning, thus limiting the unavoidable Robinson antidamping rate from the fundamental mode of a passively operated harmonic cavity to values below the synchrotron radiation damping rate. The paper is complemented by results of measurements performed in the MAX III storage ring, which showed good agreement with calculations following the fully self-consistent approach.},

The two resulting sub-bunches$\backslash$nthen collapse together in less than one synchrotron oscillation, causing$\backslash$na net blow-up in emittance.

@article{Cullinan2016,
abstract = {A small vacuum chamber aperture is a present trend in the design of future synchrotron light sources. This leads to a large resistive-wall impedance that can drive coupled-bunch instabilities. Another trend is the use of passively driven cavities at a harmonic of the main radio frequency to lengthen the electron bunches in order to increase the Touschek lifetime and reduce emittance blowup due to intrabeam scattering. In some cases, the harmonic cavities may be tuned to fulfill the flat potential condition.With this condition met, it has been predicted in simulation that the threshold current for coupled-bunch resistive- wall instabilities is much higher than with no bunch lengthening at all. In this paper, the features of a bunch in the flat potential that would contribute toward this stabilization are identified and discussed. The threshold currents for these instabilities are estimated for the MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring at different values of chromaticity using macroparticle simulations in the time domain and, within the limits of the existing theory, frequency domain calculations. By comparing the results from these two methods and analyzing the spectra of the dominant head-tail modes, the impact of each of the distinguishing features of a bunch in the flat potential can be explained and quantified in terms of the change in threshold current. It is found that, above a certain chromaticity, the threshold current is determined by the radial structure of the zeroth-order head-tail mode. This happens at a lower chromaticity if the bunch length is longer.},

abstract = {A theoretical and experimental characterisation of transverse$\backslash$ndamping mechanisms was initiated within the framework of the single$\backslash$nbunch transverse instability studies. An attempt is made to estimate the$\backslash$nmachine impedance through the measurement of the head tail damping time$\backslash$nas a function of the chromaticity. The presence of strong sextupole$\backslash$nfields used for chromaticity compensation however induces large momentum$\backslash$nand amplitude dependent tune shifts. A systematic study of the different$\backslash$ndamping mechanisms was therefore performed in order to quantify the$\backslash$ndifferent contributions, which for the ESRF storage ring are in the same$\backslash$nrange. Numerical simulations and record of the beam response to a kick$\backslash$nwere performed. The transverse signal decay after the excitation was$\backslash$nobserved on the tune monitor system used in zero span mode. The tune$\backslash$namplitude dependence which depends on the kick amplitude is discussed$\backslash$nfirst. Then the modulation induced by chromaticity overcompensation$\backslash$nwhich could blind the observation is described. The measurement of the$\backslash$nhead tail damping and growing time, under precise operating conditions,$\backslash$nwith positive and negative chromaticity, is presented. Finally, a model$\backslash$nfor the machine impedance is discussed},

abstract = {The HEADTAIL code has developed into a very versatile tool which can be used for simulations of electron cloud in- duced instabilities as well as forTransverseModeCoupling Instability and space charge studies. The effect of electron cloud and/or a conventional impedance (resonator or resis- tive wall) on a single bunch is modeled using a wake field approach. The code naturally allows either for dedicated studies of one single effect or for more complex studies of the interplay between different effects. Sample results from electron cloud studies on coherent ef- fects as well as TMCI and coherent tune shift studies will be discussed and compared with results from other codes having similar features and/or with existing machine data.},

abstract = {MAXIV will be Sweden's next-generation high-performance synchrotron radiation source. The project has recently been granted funding and construction is scheduled to begin in 2010. User operation for a broad and international user community should commence in 2015. The facility is comprised of two storage rings optimized for different wavelength ranges, a linac-based short-pulse facility and a free- electron laser for the production of coherent radiation. The main radiation source of MAX IV will be a 528multralow emittance storage ring operated at 3 GeV for the generation of high-brightness hard x rays. This storage ring was designed to meet the requirements of state-of-the-art insertion devices which will be installed in nineteen 5 m long dispersion-free straight sections. The storage ring is based on a novel multibend achromat design delivering an unprecedented horizontal bare lattice emittance of 0.33 nm rad and a vertical emittance below the 8 pmrad diffraction limit for 1 A ˚ radiation. In this paper we present the beam dynamics considerations behind this storage-ring design and detail its expected unique performance.},
