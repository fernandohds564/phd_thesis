abstract = {The fifth CERN Accelerator School (CAS) advanced course on Accelerator Physics was given at the paradise Hotel, Rhodes, Greece from 20 September to 1 October 1993. Its syllabus was based on the previous similar courses held at oxford 1985, Berlin 1987, Uppsala 1989 and Noordwijkerhout 1991, and whose proceedings were published as CERN Reports 87-03, 89-01, 90-04, respectively. The present volumes are intended to replace and to bring up to date all the material in earlier publications. They contain not only all the lectures given in the Rhodes course but a number of important contribution to previous courses which ar thought to be essential for a complete understanding of all aspects of the disign and construction of particle accelerators at an advanced level. They include sections on Hamiltonian equations and accelerator optics, chromaticity and dynamic beam aperture, paricle tracking, the kinetic theory, longitudinal beam optics, coherent instabilitis, beam-beam dynamics, intra-beam scattering, beam cooling, Schottki noise, beam radiation, neutralisation, beam polarisation, radio-frequency quadrupoles, as well as chapters on space charge, superconducting magnets, crystal bending, beam-beam measurement and accelerator medical applications.},

abstract = {The Advanced Photon Source storage ring has a number of narrow-gap insertion device vacuum chambers, and there is a plan to further increase their number. These vacuum chambers contribute to the impedance of the machine and to the impedance limits the single-bunch current threshold. In order to understand the contribution of the vacuum chambers and its dependence on the gap, the distribution of the vertical transverse impedance around the circumference of the APS storage ring has been determined using the response matrix fit method. This method allows us to find focusing errors around the storage ring and was originally used to determine and correct the linear model of the APS. The high accuracy of the method enables us to measure the variation of betatron phase advance around the ring with beam current. Results of these measurements are reported and the impedance of different parts of the storage ring is presented.},

abstract = {The design of beam position monitors ofien involves ctilenging system design choices. Position transducers must be robust, aeeurate, and generate adequate position signal without unduly disturbing the beam. Electronics must be reliable and affordable, us{\~{}}ly while meeting tough requirements on preeision. accuracy, and dynamic range. These requirements may be dficult to achieve simultaneously, lmding the designer into interesting opportunities for optimimtion or compromise. Some usefil techniques and tools are shown. Both finite element analysis and analytic techniques will be used to investigate quasi-static aspects of electromagnetic fields such as the impedance of and the coupling of beam to striplines or buttons. Finite*lement tools will be used to understand dynamic aspects of the electromagnetic fields of beams, such as w{\~{}}efields and transmission-line and cavity effects in vacuum-to-air Feedthroughs. Mathematical modeling of eleetricd signals through a processing chain will be demonstrated, in particular to illuminate areas where neither a pure timedomain nor a pure frequencydomain analysis is obviously advantageous. Emphasis will be on calculational techniques, in particular on using both time-domain and frequency domain approaches to the applicable parts of interesting problems.},

The course was held in Sigtuna, Sweden, from 1 May - 9 June 2007.this is the first time this topic has been selected for a specialized course. Taking into account the number of related applications currently in use in accelerators around the world, it was recognized that such a topic should definitevely be incorporated into the CAS serires of specialized courses. the specific aim of the course was to introduce the participants to the use and programming of Digital Signal processors (DSPs) an Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) evaluation board. The course consisted of lectures in the mornings covering fundamental background knowledge in mathematics, controls theory, design tools, programming hardware platforms, and implementation details. In the afternoons the students split into two groups with people working in pairs. One group worked on problem solving using a PC-based workstation connected to a DSP evaluation board. Half-way through the school, those working on SDPs moved to FPGAs and vice versa. The problems to be solved were of increasing difficulty and all of them were directly related to real and practical realizations currently in use in the accelerator field.},

We illustrate the proposed method with an example from electromagnetic geophysics, where the scaling is often such that our logarithmic Fourier transform (LFT) should be applied. For the example chosen, we are able to obtain results that agree with those from an FFT to within 0.5 per cent in a time that is a factor of 10� shorter. Potential applications of our LFT in geophysics include conversion of wide-band electromagnetic frequency responses to transient responses, glacial loading and unloading, aquifer recharge problems, normal mode and earth tide studies in seismology, and impulsive shock wave modelling.},

abstract = {The dynamics of charged particles in general linear focusing lattices with quadrupole, skew-quadrupole, dipole, and solenoidal components, as well as torsion of the fiducial orbit and variation of beam energy is parametrized using a generalized Courant-Snyder (CS) theory, which extends the original CS theory for one degree of freedom to higher dimensions. The envelope function is generalized into an envelope matrix, and the phase advance is generalized into a 4D symplectic rotation, or a Uð2Þ element. The 1D envelope equation, also known as the Ermakov-Milne-Pinney equation in quantum mechanics, is generalized to an envelope matrix equation in higher dimensions. Other components of the original CS theory, such as the transfer matrix, Twiss functions, and CS invariant (also known as the Lewis invariant) all have their counterparts, with remarkably similar expressions, in the generalized theory. The gauge group structure of the generalized theory is analyzed. By fixing the gauge freedom with a desired symmetry, the generalized CS parametrization assumes the form of the modified Iwasawa decomposition, whose importance in phase space optics and phase space quantum mechanics has been recently realized. This gauge fixing also symmetrizes the generalized envelope equation and expresses the theory using only the generalized Twiss function $\beta$. The generalized phase advance completely determines the spectral and structural stability properties of a general focusing lattice. For structural stability, the generalized CS theory enables application of the Krein-Moser theory to greatly simplify the stability analysis. The generalized CS theory provides an effective tool to study coupled dynamics and to discover more optimized lattice designs in the larger parameter space of general focusing lattices.},

abstract = {The main contribution into the total impedance of the VEPP-4M is made by places of non-uniformity of vacuum chamber, such as sharp change of cross section, ceramic inserts, vertical electrostatic separators and by HOMs of cavities. Computer code GdfidL is used for the estimate of impedances in some of above structures. A new method for measurement of transverse coupling impedance has been used. The method is based on measuring of closed orbit deviation caused by localized impedance. Transverse impedance acts on the beam as a defocusing quadrupole, strength of which depends on the beam current. If a local bump of closed orbit has been created at the impedance location, then the orbit deviation occurs while varying the beam current. The local impedance can be evaluated using the orbit deviation measured. The results of the measurements and numerical calculations are presented and compared.},

We study this at the Cornell electron storage ring test accelerator using a 2.1 GeV low emittance beam. As the source of ions is residual gas, our measurements are conducted at various pressures, including nominal vacuum as well as injected gas (Ar, Kr). We experiment with mitigation techniques, including changing the bunch pattern to have mini-trains instead of one long train, as well as increasing the initial vertical emittance of the beam.We also check to ensure that ion-trapping is not a substantial effect in our measurements. We measure turn-by-turn vertical bunch size and position, as well as the multibunch power spectrum. Our measurements confirm fast ion instability under all vacuum conditions. A detailed simulation is then used to compare theory with observations.},

A Hamiltonian formalism, expanded to third order in the canonical variables, has also been developed to describe the transverse motion in an accelerator. Time-dependent perturbation theory has been applied and computerized using a computer-algebra system. In particular, the perturbations due to magnetic sextupoles have been calculated to second power in the sextupole strength. The frequency spectra for the horizontal and the vertical betatron motion close to a single resonance have been calculated using time-independent perturbation theory. It has been shown that information about excited resonances and the type of driving field can be derived from the spectra. In particular, it is possible to obtain the amplitude and the phase of a given resonance. The results have been used to study the perturbations in the Low Energy Antiproton Ring (LEAR) at CERN.},

First proposed in the mm-wave spectral range by Motz, superradiant undulator radiation has been realized in the 45 um to 300 um spectral range by using sub-picosecond electron bunches produced by the SUNSHINE facility. The experimental setup and measurements of this FIR radiation are reported in this thesis. In addition to being a useful FIR source, the superradiant undulator radiation produced at SUNSHINE is an object of research in itself. Measured superlinear growth of the radiated energy along the undulator demonstrates the self-amplification of radiation by the electron bunch. This superlinear growth is seen at 47 um to 70 um wavelengths. These wavelengths are an order of magnitude shorter than in previous self-amplification demonstrations.},

abstract = {The interaction of an electron beam with residual gas ions results in mutually driven transverse oscillations. This effect arises during the passage of a single train of bunches. An equivalent instability mechanism is encountered in positron beams where ionization electrons oscillate within a single bunch. In either case, the oscillations grow exponentially with an exponent proportional to t{\^{}}1/2 . In this paper, the rise time of the instability is calculated analytically by a perturbation series approach and is compared with computer simulations. Growth rates are evaluated for several existing or proposed storage rings and linear accelerators; the effect considered could be a significant limitation in many of the future designs.},

abstract = {The Advanced Photon Source storage ring has a number of narrow-gap insertion device vacuum chambers, and there is a plan to further increase their number. These vacuum chambers contribute to the impedance of the machine and to the impedance limits the single-bunch current threshold. In order to understand the contribution of the vacuum chambers and its dependence on the gap, the distribution of the vertical transverse impedance around the circumference of the APS storage ring has been determined using the response matrix fit method. This method allows us to find focusing errors around the storage ring and was originally used to determine and correct the linear model of the APS. The high accuracy of the method enables us to measure the variation of betatron phase advance around the ring with beam current. Results of these measurements are reported and the impedance of different parts of the storage ring is presented.},

The present volumes are intended to replace and to bring up to date all the material in earlier publications. They contain not only all the lectures given in the Rhodes course but a number of important contribution to previous courses which ar thought to be essential for a complete understanding of all aspects of the disign and construction of particle accelerators at an advanced level. They include sections on Hamiltonian equations and accelerator optics, chromaticity and dynamic beam aperture, paricle tracking, the kinetic theory, longitudinal beam optics, coherent instabilitis, beam-beam dynamics, intra-beam scattering, beam cooling, Schottki noise, beam radiation, neutralisation, beam polarisation, radio-frequency quadrupoles, as well as chapters on space charge, superconducting magnets, crystal bending, beam-beam measurement and accelerator medical applications.},

@phdthesis{Rimjaem2006,
abstract = {this thesis is to design and optimize the RF-gun to achieve electron bunch length in femtosecond scale. Starting from the Stanford SUNSHINE design, the RF-gun has been optimized and constructed. These studies were performed by numerical simulation using the codes SUPERFISH and PARMELA. Systematic simulation studies were carried out to investigate the fundamental and practical limits in reducing the electron bunch length. The numerical studies include bunch length dispersion due to focusing in the transport system leading to a final bunch length of some 53 fs with a bunch charge of 94 pCb giving a peak current of 707 A. The RF-gun was constructed based on simulation results. Low-power RF measurements were performed and the results shows that the resonant frequency of the RF-gun is 2855.3 MHz at 25oC in ambient air, which can be tuned to 2856 MHz by adjusting the RF-gun temperature, and the quality factor is 12979 with the RF-coupling coefficient of about 7.5. The RF-gun and other components have been installed at the SURIYA project. The experimental results show that the electron beam of 2-2.5 MeV maximum kinetic energy and a beam current up to 1 A can be obtained from the RF-gun with input power of 3.65 MW. Electron bunches as short as 53 fs can be converted into broad band co- herent radiation in the high-intensity far-infrared (FIR) regime at wavelengths of 50-1000 µm. To verify the simulation results, a transition radiation experimental station to produce FIR transition radiation has been installed. Recently, the FIR signal from transition radiation was successfully observed and verified for the first time at SURIYA laboratory by using room temperature pyroelectric detector.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a time-frequency representation where the frequency bins are distributed uniformly in log-frequency and their Q-factors obey a linear function of the bin center frequencies. The latter allows for time-frequency representations where the bandwidths can be e.g. constant on the log-frequency scale (constant Q) or constant on the auditory critical-band scale (smoothly varying Q). The proposed techniques are published as a Matlab toolbox that extends [3]. Besides the features that stem from [3] – perfect reconstruction and computational efficiency – we propose here a technique for computing coefficient phases in a way that makes their interpretation more natural. Other extensions include flexible control of the Q-values and more regular sampling of the time-frequency plane in order to simplify signal processing in the transform domain.},

abstract = {The ionization of residual gas by an electron beam in an accelerator generates ions that can resonantly couple to the beam through a wave propagating in the beam-ion system. A beam-ion instability is studied for a multibunch train, taking into account the decoherence of ien oscillations due to the ion frequency spread. It is shown that while the decoherence does not completely suppress the instability, it makes the growth rate smaller. A comparison of analytical and numerical results indicates good agreement with direct macroparticle simulation of the instability.},

User operation for a broad and international user community should commence in 2015. The facility is comprised of two storage rings optimized for different wavelength ranges, a linac-based short-pulse facility and a free- electron laser for the production of coherent radiation. The main radiation source of MAX IV will be a 528multralow emittance storage ring operated at 3 GeV for the generation of high-brightness hard x rays. This storage ring was designed to meet the requirements of state-of-the-art insertion devices which will be installed in nineteen 5 m long dispersion-free straight sections. The storage ring is based on a novel multibend achromat design delivering an unprecedented horizontal bare lattice emittance of 0.33 nm rad and a vertical emittance below the 8 pmrad diffraction limit for 1 A ˚ radiation. In this paper we present the beam dynamics considerations behind this storage-ring design and detail its expected unique performance.},

abstract = {The equilibrium self-consistent distribution of particles in a$\backslash$nhigh intensity electron synchrotron can be found using the Haissinski$\backslash$nequation and the wake field.

However, radiation damping causes the particles to be$\backslash$nconfined and the instability does not necessarily cause loss of$\backslash$nparticles. It was observed in simulations with a very simple wake field$\backslash$nand short bunches, that energy spread and bunch length oscillate in a$\backslash$nsawtooth fashion. We find that this is due to the double-peaked nature$\backslash$nof the stationary distribution. Over many synchrotron oscillations,$\backslash$nparticles diffuse from the head peak to the tail to the point where the$\backslash$ntail peak becomes as large as the head. The two resulting sub-bunches$\backslash$nthen collapse together in less than one synchrotron oscillation, causing$\backslash$na net blow-up in emittance.

The presence of strong sextupole$\backslash$nfields used for chromaticity compensation however induces large momentum$\backslash$nand amplitude dependent tune shifts. A systematic study of the different$\backslash$ndamping mechanisms was therefore performed in order to quantify the$\backslash$ndifferent contributions, which for the ESRF storage ring are in the same$\backslash$nrange. Numerical simulations and record of the beam response to a kick$\backslash$nwere performed. The transverse signal decay after the excitation was$\backslash$nobserved on the tune monitor system used in zero span mode. The tune$\backslash$namplitude dependence which depends on the kick amplitude is discussed$\backslash$nfirst. Then the modulation induced by chromaticity overcompensation$\backslash$nwhich could blind the observation is described. The measurement of the$\backslash$nhead tail damping and growing time, under precise operating conditions,$\backslash$nwith positive and negative chromaticity, is presented. Finally, a model$\backslash$nfor the machine impedance is discussed},

The proposed techniques are published as a Matlab toolbox that extends [3]. Besides the features that stem from [3] – perfect reconstruction and computational efficiency – we propose here a technique for computing coefficient phases in a way that makes their interpretation more natural. Other extensions include flexible control of the Q-values and more regular sampling of the time-frequency plane in order to simplify signal processing in the transform domain.},

@article{Zagorodnov2005,
abstract = {The Yee finite-difference time domain method (FDTD) is commonly used in wake field and particle-in-cell simulations. However, in accelerator modeling the high energy particles can travel in vacuum faster than their own radiation. This effect is commonly referred to as numerical Cherenkov radiation and is a consequence of numerical grid dispersion. Several numerical approaches are proposed to reduce the dispersion for all angles and for a given frequency range, that justifies itself for domains big in all three directions. On the contrary, in accelerator modeling the transverse dimensions and transverse beam velocity are small, but it is extremely important to eliminate the dispersion error in the well-defined direction of the beam motion for all frequencies. In this paper we propose a new two-level economical conservative scheme for electromagnetic field calculations in three dimensions. The scheme does not have dispersion in the longitudinal direction and is staircase-free (second order convergent). Unlike the FDTD method, it is based on a “transversal-electric/transversal-magnetic” (TE/TM)-like splitting of the field components in time. The scheme assures energy and charge conservation. Additionally, the usage of damping terms allows suppressing high frequency noise generated due to the transverse dispersion and the current fluctuations. The dispersion relation of the damping scheme is analyzed. As numerical examples show, the new scheme is much more accurate on the long-time scale than the conventional FDTD approach. },

abstract = {A method is presented for determining the stability of a system consisting of several highly relativistic bunches of charged particles circulating in a storage ring. The particles interact with magnets designed to guide the beam as well as with electromagnetic fields induced by the particles themselves. Previous work has considered modes where all bunches in the ring are executing the same type of internal oscillation. This dissertation considers the results of allowing those modes to couple to one another. The formalism begins with a self- consistent distribution, and analyzes small perturbations to that distribution to determine if they grow exponentially. The formalism allows one to do this computation for an arbitrary magnetic lattice, as well as an arbitrary distribution of wakefield sources around the ring. The method also allows for the inclusion of a feedback system which is designed to damp multibunch oscillations. The PEP-II B-factory with a linear lattice is used as an example to demonstrate and explain the phenomenology that results from this coupling of multibunch modes. The effect of adding feedback is also explored.},
