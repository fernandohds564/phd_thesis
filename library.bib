abstract = {The Matsumoto-Ohtsuka ?MO?-type vacuum flange, which can provide a gapless connection and a highly reliable electric contact between flanges, was studied experimentally for a possible application to beam ducts for high-current accelerators, where the apertures have a complicated structure, such as the combination of a beam channel and one or two flat rectangular antechambers. In spite of the complex aperture, test flanges showed a good vacuum-sealing property. Vacuum sealing was successfully achieved with a reasonable fastening torque ?15–20 N m?, and remained sealed after baking at 250 °C for 24 h. A twist between flanges of up to about 5 mrad was also manageable. A pseudoelastic structural analysis well reproduced the observed deformation of the flange. This analysis should be available for optimizing the flange structure. The MO-type vacuum flange was found to be promising for connecting flanges of the beam duct with a complicated aperture in future accelerators. The flange will also be available as a compact vacuum flange in cases where a complex aperture is required.},

abstract = {Getters are solid materials capable of chemisorbing gas molecules on their surface: getters are chemical pumps. They are widely used for a variety of applications such as in parti- cle accelerators, vacuum tubes, field-emission display (FED), inert gas purification systems, H2 plasma purification, hydrogen species recycling as in the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor. Among the different Non-Evaporable Getter (NEG) materials tested, the TiZrV alloys have the lowest activation temperature. For this reason, the TiZrV coatings were the object of this work. In particular, the aim of this investigation was to understand how to optimise three important properties of TiZrV coatings: to achieve the lowest possible activation tem- perature (Ta), and to obtain the highest pumping speed and surface pumping capacity. This objective is important in the context of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) accelerator, since, before this work, the understanding and the knowledge of the TiZrV coating properties were insufficient to adopt it for this machine. In the present investigation, TiZrV coatings (250 samples) of various compositions have been deposited by DC (Direct-Current) diode magnetron sputtering. The influence of the substrate material, substrate roughness, substrate temperature (Ts), film composition, on the activation temperature and pumping properties have been investigated in order to optimise the deposition parameters for vacuum applications. The characterisation of the films has been carried out by Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) for the surface and bulk chemical compo- sition, respectively, and by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy (STM) for the morphology and crystallinity. The performances of the best coatings selected through the above mentioned methods have been investigated by pumping speed measurements of H2,COand N2.},

abstract = {The Fokker-Planck equation for transverse collective instabilities is solved by expansion in terms of generalized Laguerre polynomials. The convergence of the expansion is confirmed by computer calculation to be very rapid. Compared with the Vlasov equation treatment, the threshold of transverse mode-coupling instability in PEP, PETRA, and TRISTAN is shown to be somewhat lowered, owing to radiation effects. Dipole oscillations are excited before the eigenfrequencies of two modes (m = 0 and m = -1) meet. It is also shown that when the Vlasov equation is used to study the coupled-bunch instability an approximate stability criterion is that the growth rate should be less than 1/t'{\~{}} + Iml/t's' where t'{\~{}} and t's are radiation damping times for betatron and synchrotron oscillations, respectively, and m is the azimuthal mode number. Higher radial modes are damped more strongly.},

abstract = {Fast ion instability can lead to deterioration of an electron beam (increasing emittance and instability of a train of bunches) in storage rings and linacs. We study this at the Cornell electron storage ring test accelerator using a 2.1 GeV low emittance beam. As the source of ions is residual gas, our measurements are conducted at various pressures, including nominal vacuum as well as injected gas (Ar, Kr). We experiment with mitigation techniques, including changing the bunch pattern to have mini-trains instead of one long train, as well as increasing the initial vertical emittance of the beam.We also check to ensure that ion-trapping is not a substantial effect in our measurements. We measure turn-by-turn vertical bunch size and position, as well as the multibunch power spectrum. Our measurements confirm fast ion instability under all vacuum conditions. A detailed simulation is then used to compare theory with observations.},

The course was held in Sigtuna, Sweden, from 1 May - 9 June 2007.this is the first time this topic has been selected for a specialized course. Taking into account the number of related applications currently in use in accelerators around the world, it was recognized that such a topic should definitevely be incorporated into the CAS serires of specialized courses. the specific aim of the course was to introduce the participants to the use and programming of Digital Signal processors (DSPs) an Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) evaluation board. The course consisted of lectures in the mornings covering fundamental background knowledge in mathematics, controls theory, design tools, programming hardware platforms, and implementation details. In the afternoons the students split into two groups with people working in pairs. One group worked on problem solving using a PC-based workstation connected to a DSP evaluation board. Half-way through the school, those working on SDPs moved to FPGAs and vice versa. The problems to be solved were of increasing difficulty and all of them were directly related to real and practical realizations currently in use in the accelerator field.},

Transverse impedance acts on the beam as a defocusing quadrupole, strength of which depends on the beam current. If a local bump of closed orbit has been created at the impedance location, then the orbit deviation occurs while varying the beam current. The local impedance can be evaluated using the orbit deviation measured. Measurement technique is described, the method accuracy is evaluated.

abstract = {The dynamics of charged particles in general linear focusing lattices with quadrupole, skew-quadrupole, dipole, and solenoidal components, as well as torsion of the fiducial orbit and variation of beam energy is parametrized using a generalized Courant-Snyder (CS) theory, which extends the original CS theory for one degree of freedom to higher dimensions. The envelope function is generalized into an envelope matrix, and the phase advance is generalized into a 4D symplectic rotation, or a Uð2Þ element. The 1D envelope equation, also known as the Ermakov-Milne-Pinney equation in quantum mechanics, is generalized to an envelope matrix equation in higher dimensions. Other components of the original CS theory, such as the transfer matrix, Twiss functions, and CS invariant (also known as the Lewis invariant) all have their counterparts, with remarkably similar expressions, in the generalized theory. The gauge group structure of the generalized theory is analyzed. By fixing the gauge freedom with a desired symmetry, the generalized CS parametrization assumes the form of the modified Iwasawa decomposition, whose importance in phase space optics and phase space quantum mechanics has been recently realized. This gauge fixing also symmetrizes the generalized envelope equation and expresses the theory using only the generalized Twiss function {\$}\beta{\$}. The generalized phase advance completely determines the spectral and structural stability properties of a general focusing lattice. For structural stability, the generalized CS theory enables application of the Krein-Moser theory to greatly simplify the stability analysis. The generalized CS theory provides an effective tool to study coupled dynamics and to discover more optimized lattice designs in the larger parameter space of general focusing lattices.},

The short- range wakepotential has been optimized taking into account vertical offset of RF fingers from their nominal position. The results were compared with data of bellows designed at other laboratories. Narrow-band impedance of the BPM Button has been studied. TE-modes in the BPM button were suppressed by a factor of 8 by modification of existing housings. Two new types of housings are shown.

abstract = {A systematic review of theoretical results for the longitudinal and transverse impedances obtained by different methods is presented. Definitions, general theorems, modal analysis, diffraction model, and analytical results comprise the content of the paper. Several new results are included. In particular, necessary and sufficient conditions for the independence of the impedance on the beam longitudinal direc- tion are given. The impedances of two basic simple structures — that of a cavity and that of a step — are studied in detail. The transition from the regime of a cavity to the regime of a step is explained, an ap- proximate formula describing this transition is given, and the criterion for determining the applicability of each regime is established. The asymptotic behavior of the impedance for a finite number Mof periodical- ly arranged cavities as a function ofM is studied. The difference in the behavior of the impedance for a single cavity and that for an infinite number of cavities is explained as the result of the interference of the diffracted waves. A criterion for determining the transition in the impedance behavior from small M to large Mis presented.},

abstract = {Microwave instability in the low energy ring of KEKB was studied using a broadband impedance model. The model gave excellent descriptions of longitudinal dynamics for both positive and negative momentum compactions. Moreover, it predicted that the threshold of microwave instability was a factor of 2 lower than the machine nominal operating bunch current. The prediction was confirmed by a measurement using the Belle detector. Furthermore, we integrated the longitudinal wakefield into the beam-beam simulation and applied it to study the combined effects in KEKB. As a result, the beam-beam simulation became truly three dimensional with emittance growth in all three dimensions simultaneously as the beam currents increase. In addition, an observed mystery of asymmetry in the horizontal scan could also be explained by our simulations.},

abstract = {Charged particle beams in circular accelerators often become unstable and execute coherent transverse oscillations that grow in amplitude. These are driven by deflecting fields set up by currents induced in the vacuum chamber walls or other equipment by the oscillating beam itself. This unwanted interaction between the beam and its surroundings is charac- terized by a transverse coupling impedance Z T. We show that it is relatively easy to measure Z T for accelerator com- ponents with large impedance such as kicker magnets, and that useful results can also be obtained for components with small impedance, such as vacuum chambers, although in this case one is close to the limits of accuracy with ordinary laboratory equipment.},

abstract = {Storing particles inside an electron-positron collider brings about the need for low pressures to reduce interactions with residual gas molecules. In order to provide electron beams with a lifetime of 20 h, an average pressure of about 3 x 10 -9 Torr is needed for the Large Electron Positron Collider (LEP), the construction of which has started in the proximity of CERN. Maintaining such a low pressure in spite of the small chamber cross-section and of the large degassing induced by synchrotron light requires an evenly distributed pumping speed. Traditionally, the problem is solved by means of integrated sputter ion pumps which are inserted all along the vacuum chamber and which make use of the field of the bending magnets. More recently a different linear pump, based on the use of a non-evaporable getter (NEG), was proposed. Laboratory measurements as well as real testing in an existing e+e - collider (PETRA at DESY), showed the feasibility and the advantages of this solution. The results which lead to the choice of NEG as main pump for LEP are presented and discussed.},

@article{Cullinan2016,
abstract = {A small vacuum chamber aperture is a present trend in the design of future synchrotron light sources. This leads to a large resistive-wall impedance that can drive coupled-bunch instabilities. Another trend is the use of passively driven cavities at a harmonic of the main radio frequency to lengthen the electron bunches in order to increase the Touschek lifetime and reduce emittance blowup due to intrabeam scattering. In some cases, the harmonic cavities may be tuned to fulfill the flat potential condition.With this condition met, it has been predicted in simulation that the threshold current for coupled-bunch resistive- wall instabilities is much higher than with no bunch lengthening at all. In this paper, the features of a bunch in the flat potential that would contribute toward this stabilization are identified and discussed. The threshold currents for these instabilities are estimated for the MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring at different values of chromaticity using macroparticle simulations in the time domain and, within the limits of the existing theory, frequency domain calculations. By comparing the results from these two methods and analyzing the spectra of the dominant head-tail modes, the impact of each of the distinguishing features of a bunch in the flat potential can be explained and quantified in terms of the change in threshold current. It is found that, above a certain chromaticity, the threshold current is determined by the radial structure of the zeroth-order head-tail mode. This happens at a lower chromaticity if the bunch length is longer.},

Both rings make use of a 100 MHz RF system and are designed to operate with a uniform multibunch fill pattern aswell as employ passive harmonic cavities to damp instabilities and increase Touschek lifetime. Recently, a discussion on timing modes at the MAX IV storage rings has been initiated by the user community. This implies operating the rings with other fill patterns than the originally planned multibunch mode and therefore detailed studies of the performance of the harmonic cavities are of interest. This paper presents bunch length measurements at the 100 MHz MAX II storage ring for uniform fill patterns. The purpose of the measurements was to evaluate the employed measurement method and simulation codes for future studies of fill patterns in the MAX IV storage rings.},

Both longitudinal and transverse impedances slowly undergo transitions from the resistive-wall impedances of the copper-only chamber to those of the NEG-only chamber over a 0.1–100GHz frequency range. They start to deviate from the conventional impedance lines for the NEG-only chamber at ∼100 GHz. They increase first to ∼1THz and then decrease rapidly as a function of the frequency. Numerical examples of the resistive-wall impedances are presented up to ∼100THz using similar parameters to those of the SLS-II (Swiss Light Source) upgrade.We briefly discuss the characteristic of a loss factor for the chamber with NEG coating.},

abstract = {In the design of the vacuum chamber of a storage ring, special care has to be taken to keep the impedance as low as possible, in order to not degrade the quality of the circulating beam. Since the start of the commissioning of the Italian synchrotron light source ELETTRA in 1993, several low gap insertion vacuum chambers with internal aperture of 14 mm have been installed into the storage ring. Monitoring of their individual impedances and effects has been carried out with measurements on the electron beam after each new installation. The subsequent evolutions of the total longitudinal and transverse impedances are presented in this paper. Furthermore, in contradiction with the foreseen single-bunch effect, noticeable excitations of particular narrow band longitudinal coupled multibunch instabilities as a function of the position of the blades of the vertical scraper have been observed. In order to achieve a deeper insight of the phenomenon, an exhaustive characterization of both the longitudinal and transverse impedances of the scraper has been carried out.},

abstract = {Although beamline instrumentation is by nature driven by science, some recent examples serve as reminders that new technologies also enable new science. Indeed, exploiting the full scientific potential of forthcoming new storage rings with unprecedented source characteristics will, in many cases, require the development and implementation of novel instrumentation. In comparison with present synchrotron radiation facilities, the majority of beamlines should reap immediate performance benefits from the improved source emittance, principally through increased flux and/or horizontal beam size reduction at the sample. Instrumentation will have to develop along similar quantitative and qualitative trends. More speculative and more challenging is anticipating instrumentation that will be required by the new science made possible thanks to the unique coherence properties of diffraction-limited storage rings (DLSRs). ESRF has recently carried out a detailed feasibility study for a new ultra-low-emittance 6 GeV hybrid multibend storage ring, identified as ESRF Upgrade Programme Phase II. Although its performance is not expected to be equivalent to a DLSR source, the successful implementation of the ESRF Phase II project has to address scientific instrumentation issues that are also common to DLSRs. This article aims at providing a comprehensive review of some of the challenges encountered by the ESRF, in the context of the preparation of Phase II of its upgrade programme.},

abstract = {The dynamics of charged particles in general linear focusing lattices with quadrupole, skew-quadrupole, dipole, and solenoidal components, as well as torsion of the fiducial orbit and variation of beam energy is parametrized using a generalized Courant-Snyder (CS) theory, which extends the original CS theory for one degree of freedom to higher dimensions. The envelope function is generalized into an envelope matrix, and the phase advance is generalized into a 4D symplectic rotation, or a Uð2Þ element. The 1D envelope equation, also known as the Ermakov-Milne-Pinney equation in quantum mechanics, is generalized to an envelope matrix equation in higher dimensions. Other components of the original CS theory, such as the transfer matrix, Twiss functions, and CS invariant (also known as the Lewis invariant) all have their counterparts, with remarkably similar expressions, in the generalized theory. The gauge group structure of the generalized theory is analyzed. By fixing the gauge freedom with a desired symmetry, the generalized CS parametrization assumes the form of the modified Iwasawa decomposition, whose importance in phase space optics and phase space quantum mechanics has been recently realized. This gauge fixing also symmetrizes the generalized envelope equation and expresses the theory using only the generalized Twiss function $\beta$. The generalized phase advance completely determines the spectral and structural stability properties of a general focusing lattice. For structural stability, the generalized CS theory enables application of the Krein-Moser theory to greatly simplify the stability analysis. The generalized CS theory provides an effective tool to study coupled dynamics and to discover more optimized lattice designs in the larger parameter space of general focusing lattices.},

abstract = {Explosions are spectacular and intriguing phenomena that expose the dynamics of matter under extreme conditions. We investigated, using time-resolved imaging, explosions induced by ultraintense X-ray laser pulses in water drops and jets. Our observations revealed an explosive vaporization followed by high-velocity interacting flows of liquid and vapour, and by the generation of shock trains in the liquid jets. These flows are diierent from those previously observed in laser ablation, owing to a simpler spatial pattern of X-ray absorption. We show that the explosion dynamics in our experiments is consistent with a redistribution of absorbed energy, mediated by a pressure or shock wave in the liquid, and we model the eeects of explosions, including their adverse impact on X-ray laser experiments. X-ray laser explosions have predictable dynamics that may prove useful for controlling the state of pure liquids over broad energy scales and timescales, and for triggering pressure-sensitive molecular dynamics in solutions. E xplosions are encountered in a wide range of natural and man-made systems. From supernovae at astrophysical scales 1 , to the laser-induced microexplosions that are used in laser surgery 2 , explosions generate high energy densities that transform rapidly into heat and kinetic energy. These processes can provide unique insights into the properties and dynamics of matter under extreme conditions 3,4 . To study the release of high energy densities, explosions can be produced safely and conveniently by illuminating microscopic volumes of matter with high-energy laser pulses 4,5 . An example of such a process is the laser ablation of liquid water 6–15 , which is an important and interesting system in its own right, but is also relevant to applications of ablation, because bulk water is used as a model of soft biological tissue in laser surgery 2,16 . Laser ablation in bulk water includes separable and quantifiable processes of nonlinear optical absorption, formation of plasma bubbles, and generation of shock waves 6–8 . Also, laser ablation in micrometre-sized drops and jets of water can be used to study chemistry at high temperatures and pres-sures 9 , or to generate extreme ultraviolet light 12,17 . However, ablation in drops and jets generates complex hydrodynamic phenomena 10,11},

The new al- gorithmallows more than 72 different types ofmaterial fill- ing for each cell, whereas the common diagonal filling only allows 7 types. With the improvedmaterial filling, the dis- cretization error is reduced by a factor of ten. The improved meshing is implemented both in the resonant solver and the time domain solver. The implementation of the generalized diagonal fillings is described. Computed frequencies for a sphere are given to show the reduction in discretization er- ror. For resonant fields, GdfidL allows periodic boundary conditions in all three cartesian directions simultaneously. It is shown that, although periodic boundary conditions lead to an eigenvalue problem with a complex matrix, the matrix iterations can be carried out mostly in real arith- metic. As an example for the application of periodic bound- ary conditions, the dispersion relation of some artificial crystal is computed.},

abstract = {In this paper we discuss representations of charge particle densities in particle-in-cell simulations, analyze the sources and profiles of the intrinsic numerical noise, and present efficient methods for their removal. We devise two alternative estimation methods for charged particle distribution which represent significant improvement over the Monte Carlo cosine expansion used in the 2D code of Bassi et al., designed to simulate coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) in charged particle beams. The improvement is achieved by employing an alternative beam density estimation to the Monte Carlo cosine expansion. The representation is first binned onto a finite grid, after which two grid-based methods are employed to approximate particle distributions: (i) truncated fast cosine transform; and (ii) thresholded wavelet transform (TWT). We demonstrate that these alternative methods represent a staggering upgrade over the original Monte Carlo cosine expansion in terms of efficiency, while the TWT approximation also provides an appreciable improvement in accuracy. The improvement in accuracy comes from a judicious removal of the numerical noise enabled by the wavelet formulation. The TWT method is then integrated into the CSR code, and benchmarked against the original version. We show that the new density estimation method provides a superior performance in terms of efficiency and spatial resolution, thus enabling high-fidelity simulations of CSR effects, including microbunching instability. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The design for the Sirius full energy booster has been modified after the decision to change the storage ring lattice from TBA to 5BA in July 2012. In the new design the booster is concentric with the storage ring and shares the same tunnel. The achieved emittance of 3.7 nm.rad at 3 GeV for this large booster (496.8 m circumference) is better matched to the 5BA storage ring emittance of 0.28 nm.rad. Good nonlinear behaviour and efficient closed orbit correction in the presence of realistic errors are shown. Injection and extraction schemes and eddy current effects during ramping are also discussed. INTRODUCTION},

@article{Johansson2014,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring, currently under construction, pursues the goal of low electron beam emittance by using a multi-bend achromat magnet lattice, which is realised by having several consecutive magnet elements precision-machined out of a common solid iron block, 2.3–3.4 m long. With this magnet design solution, instead of having 1320 individual magnets, the MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring is built up using 140 integrated `magnet block' units, containing all these magnet elements. Major features of this magnet block design are compactness, vibration stability and that the alignment of magnet elements within each unit is given by the mechanical accuracy of the CNC machining rather than individual field measurement and adjustment. This article presents practical engineering details of implementing this magnet design solution, and mechanical + magnetic field measurement results from the magnet production series. At the time of writing (spring 2014), the production series, which is totally outsourced to industry, is roughly half way through, with mechanical/magnetic QA conforming to specifications. It is the conclusion of the authors that the MAX IV magnet block concept, which has sometimes been described as new or innovative, is from a manufacturing point of view simply a collection of known mature production methods and measurement procedures, which can be executed at fixed cost with a low level of risk.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

For example, the design for the Spallation Neutron Source storage ring specifies fractional beam losses of the order of 1024, so that even small instabilities or resonances can lead to the violation of this number. The purpose of this paper is to show that there exist potentially important beam fields, missing from standard analyses, that can lead either to instabilities or to large deviations of instability thresholds from their conventional values. Some of these fields and related effects, e.g., “fast damping,” were discovered earlier and are presented here in more standard form as an extension of the wake field's definition. In addition, nonrelativistic collective phenomena are analyzed. It is shown that the nonrelativistic case could be significantly different from the rela- tivistic case.},

These emittances include the contribution of intrabeam scattering at a nominal current of 200 mA in 3300 bunches. This quality beam in conjunction with a conventional 4-m undulator in a straight section can generate synchrotron radiation having a spectral brightness above 1022[photons/s/mm2/mrad2/0.1{\%}BW] at a 10 keV photon energy. The high coherence at the diffraction limit makes this design competitive with 4th generation light sources based on an energy recovery linac. In addition, the beam lifetime is several hours and the dynamic aperture is large enough to allow off-axis injection. The alignment and stability tolerances, though challenging, are achievable. A ring with all these properties is only possible because of several major advances in mitigating the effects of nonlinear resonances. ? 2012 American Physical Society.},

This paper describes a method, which is the generalization of Sacherer's theory without mode couplings, to analyze the fast transverse instability in a Gaussian bunch. This method includes the radial modes and requires negative azimuthal modes. It makes clear that the fast instability in PEP and PETRA is caused by the mode coupling between the azimuthal modes m = 0 and m = -1, and that its growth rate rises very rapidly above the threshold. The method also predicts that the threshold current could not be improved by a large factor even if the bunch length is increased to several centimeters. The TRISTAN threshold current estimated by scaling from the PEP experimental data is about 3.5 mA per bunch for the worst case. ?? 1983.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Some of the characteristics of recent ultralow-emittance storage-ring designs and possibly future diffraction-limited storage rings are a compact lattice combined with small magnet apertures. Such requirements present a challenge for the design and performance of the vacuum system. The vacuum system should provide the required vacuum pressure for machine operation and be able to handle the heat load from synchrotron radiation. Small magnet apertures result in the conductance of the chamber being low, and lumped pumps are ineffective. One way to provide the required vacuum level is by distributed pumping, which can be realised by the use of a non-evaporable getter (NEG) coating of the chamber walls. It may not be possible to use crotch absorbers to absorb the heat from the synchrotron radiation because an antechamber is difficult to realise with such a compact lattice. To solve this, the chamber walls can work as distributed absorbers if they are made of a material with good thermal conductivity, and distributed cooling is used at the location where the synchrotron radiation hits the wall. The vacuum system of the 3 GeV storage ring of MAX IV is used as an example of possible solutions for vacuum technologies for diffraction-limited storage rings.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {-- In this paper we find the short range resistive wall wakefields of a point particle in a cylindrical tube, both for a dc model of conductivity and for an ac model. The distance scale SO depends on the radius of the tube and on the conductivity of the metal walls, and in typical structures is on the order of tens of microns. For both ac and dc models the short range wakefield is found to be well approximated by a simple, high frequency resonator wakefield. For the dc model of conductivity the frequency of the resonance is given by w/c = fi/ so and the Q-factor equals a/2. We provide a physical model to explain these results. For the ac model of conduc- tivity the resonance frequency depends also on the relaxation time of the metal 7. For large cr/so the frequency becomes w/c = dm, with oP the plasma frequency of the metal and b the tube radius, and the Q-factor becomes large. Finally we obtain the wakefields of a short Gaussian bunch, and then calculate the loss factor. From our results we find that, even for short bunches, the loss factor for the ac model is only slightly larger than that for the dc model.},

abstract = {X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) have the potential to revolutionize macromolecular structural biology due to the unique combination of spatial coherence, extreme peak brilliance, and short duration of X-ray pulses. A recently emerged serial femtosecond (fs) crystallography (SFX) approach using XFEL radiation overcomes some of the biggest hurdles of traditional crystallography related to radiation damage through the diffraction-before-destruction principle. Intense fs XFEL pulses enable high-resolution room-temperature structure determination of difficult-to-crystallize biological macromolecules, while simultaneously opening a new era of time-resolved structural studies. Here, we review the latest developments in instrumentation, sample delivery, data analysis, crystallization methods, and applications of SFX to important biological questions, and conclude with brief insights into the bright future of structural biology using XFELs. XFELs allow radiation damage to be overcome, enabling the determination of high-resolution room-temperature structures of difficult-to-crystallize proteins, for which only small crystals are available, and of extremely radiation-sensitive macromolecules, such as metalloenzymes. De novo phasing at XFELs has been established on several different targets and by different methods, thereby enabling the determination of the structure of novel macromolecules of biological interest. The extremely short fs duration of XFEL pulses provides access to dynamic information about unstable intermediate states and irreversible reactions. The development of new injectors, crystal delivery media, and fixed target devices has dramatically reduced the amount of required crystallized protein. Mixing injectors provide an important avenue to study biological interactions in 4D space. Developments in data-processing software have reduced the required amount of data and improved data quality.},

abstract = {A method is presented for determining the stability of a system consisting of several highly relativistic bunches of charged particles circulating in a storage ring. The particles interact with magnets designed to guide the beam as well as with electromagnetic fields induced by the particles themselves. Previous work has considered modes where all bunches in the ring are executing the same type of internal oscillation. This dissertation considers the results of allowing those modes to couple to one another. The formalism begins with a self- consistent distribution, and analyzes small perturbations to that distribution to determine if they grow exponentially. The formalism allows one to do this computation for an arbitrary magnetic lattice, as well as an arbitrary distribution of wakefield sources around the ring. The method also allows for the inclusion of a feedback system which is designed to damp multibunch oscillations. The PEP-II B-factory with a linear lattice is used as an example to demonstrate and explain the phenomenology that results from this coupling of multibunch modes. The effect of adding feedback is also explored.},

abstract = {Microbunching instability arises in storage rings when the number of electrons in a bunch exceeds a threshold value [1, 2, 3]. Its signature, i.e. a strong and irregular emission of Coherent Synchrotron Radiation (CSR) in the Terahertz (THz) domain, is studied at SOLEIL on the AILES infrared beamline [4], with the storage ring tuned in a low-alpha configuration (used to get shorter electron bunch) [5, 6]. The comparison of this observed THz CSR with numerical simulations of the longitudinal electron bunch dynamics permits to put in evidence that during the instability a modulation appears and drifts in the longitudinal profile of the electron bunch. The understanding of this instability is important as it limits some operation of the storage rings. Indeed the induced fluctuations prevent the use of THz on the far IR beamline at high current per bunch. In addition, in normal alpha operation this instability may spoil the electron/laser interaction effects required to get femtosecond and/or coherent pulse in storage rings (with slicing [7], Coherent Harmonic Generation or Echo-Enabled Harmonic Generation schemes on storage ring).

Since emittance scales inversely cu- bically with the number of lattice cells, an SLS upgrade is challenged by the comparatively small ring circumference of only 288 m. A new concept for a compact low emittane lattice is based on longitudinal gradient bending magnets for emittance minimization and on anti-bends (i.e bends of op- posite field polarity) to disentangle dispersion and horizontal beta function in order to provide the optimum matching to the longitudinal gradient bends while minimizing the contri- bution to chromaticity.},

An innovative approach is adopted to enhance the performance of the storage ring dipoles by combining low field (0.5 T) magnets for the main beam deflection and a short slice of high field magnet. This short slice will create a high bending field (2.0 T) only over a short longitudinal extent, generating high critical photon energy with modest energy loss from the complete dipole.

In the theoretical calculations, a threshold exists beyond which the solutions begin to di-verge. On the other hand, the CSR wake can also excite a microbunching instability which prevents stable emission of CSR for high currents and leads to highly intense bursts of radiation. In this paper the development of the calcu-lated bunch shapes and the corresponding moments of the current distribution for varying bunch currents are stud-ied. It can be shown that the bursting-stable threshold at the ANKA storage ring, in good agreement with theory, is close but not identical to the point where the bunch-shape calculations diverge.},

Calculation shows that a simplified approach based on the Vlasov equation can be taken when combined with an approximate stability criterion that the growth rate should be less than Imllt, where m is the azimuthal mode number and t is the radiation damping time for synchrotron oscillations. Fast instability occurs when coupling between different azimuthal modes is taken into account. The threshold of this instability calculated by the Fokker-Planck equation is almost equal to that obtained by the Vlasov equation.

abstract = {We have probed the transverse impedance of the ESRF storage ring using different methods and obtained data about the localisation and the frequency dependency of the impedance of our storage ring. We first used the local bump method [1]; it allowed us to accurately compare the impedance of various components of our ID straight sections: low gap vacuum chamber, scraper, in-vacuum undulator. We also used a method based on the measurement of the second derivative of the beam energy loss per turn with respect to its transverse position. Though this method has a much lower sensitivity than the previous one, it enabled to obtain information on the global transverse impedance of the whole machine at different frequencies of the spectum from about 6 to 30 GHz. This frequency scan was obtained by applying the transverse beam position offset with the proper time shape, and measuring the beam energy loss per turn induced by this perturbation for various chromaticity settings. This paper describes our measurement set up and data analysis method and gives measurement results.},

We study this at the Cornell electron storage ring test accelerator using a 2.1 GeV low emittance beam. As the source of ions is residual gas, our measurements are conducted at various pressures, including nominal vacuum as well as injected gas (Ar, Kr). We experiment with mitigation techniques, including changing the bunch pattern to have mini-trains instead of one long train, as well as increasing the initial vertical emittance of the beam.We also check to ensure that ion-trapping is not a substantial effect in our measurements. We measure turn-by-turn vertical bunch size and position, as well as the multibunch power spectrum. Our measurements confirm fast ion instability under all vacuum conditions. A detailed simulation is then used to compare theory with observations.},

It analyses the progress in accelerator technology enabling a significant increase in brightness and coherent fraction of the X-ray light provided by storage rings. With MAX IV and Sirius there are two facilities under construction that already exploit these advantages. Several other projects are in the design stage and these will probably enhance the performance further. To translate the progress in light source quality into new science requires similar progress in aspects such as optics, beamline technology, detectors and data analysis. The quality of new science will be limited by the weakest component in this value chain. Breakthroughs can be expected in high-resolution imaging, microscopy and spectroscopy. These techniques are relevant for many fields of science; for example, for the fundamental understanding of the properties of correlated electron materials, the development and characterization of materials for data and energy storage, environmental applications and bio-medicine.},

abstract = {We present the multibunch tracking code mbtrack developed to simulate, in 6-dimensional phase space, single- and multibunch collective instabilities driven by short- and long-range wakefields in storage rings. Multiple bunches, each composed of a large number of macroparticles, are tracked, allowing simulation of both intra- and interbunch motions. Besides analytical impedance models, the code allows employment of numerical wake potentials computed with electromagnetic (EM) field solvers. The corresponding impedances are fitted to a number of known analytical functions and the coefficients obtained in the fit are used as an input to the code. mbtrack performs a dynamic treatment of long-range resistive-wall and harmonic cavity fields, which are likely to be the two major factors impacting multibunch collective motions in many present and future ring-based light sources. Furthermore, it is capable of simulating beam-ion interactions as well as transverse bunch-by-bunch feedback. We describe the physical effects considered in the code and their implementation, which makes use of parallel processing to significantly shorten the computation time. mbtrack is benchmarked against other codes and applied to the MAX IV 3GeV ring as an example, where the importance of the interplay of various physical effects as well as coupling among different degrees of freedom is demonstrated.},

abstract = {The main contribution into the total impedance of the VEPP-4M is made by places of non-uniformity of vacuum chamber, such as sharp change of cross section, ceramic inserts, vertical electrostatic separators and by HOMs of cavities. Computer code GdfidL is used for the estimate of impedances in some of above structures. A new method for measurement of transverse coupling impedance has been used. The method is based on measuring of closed orbit deviation caused by localized impedance. Transverse impedance acts on the beam as a defocusing quadrupole, strength of which depends on the beam current. If a local bump of closed orbit has been created at the impedance location, then the orbit deviation occurs while varying the beam current. The local impedance can be evaluated using the orbit deviation measured. The results of the measurements and numerical calculations are presented and compared.},

The procedure is significantly more efficient computationally than the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) for transforming functions or measured responses which decay slowly with increasing abscissa value. We illustrate the proposed method with an example from electromagnetic geophysics, where the scaling is often such that our logarithmic Fourier transform (LFT) should be applied. For the example chosen, we are able to obtain results that agree with those from an FFT to within 0.5 per cent in a time that is a factor of 10� shorter. Potential applications of our LFT in geophysics include conversion of wide-band electromagnetic frequency responses to transient responses, glacial loading and unloading, aquifer recharge problems, normal mode and earth tide studies in seismology, and impulsive shock wave modelling.},

abstract = {After a brief summary of the ideas underlying the quantum theory of dispersion it is shown that it can be applied to the refraction of x-rays, although the assumption that the number of atoms in a wave length cube is large is no longer satisfied. A general formula for the index of refraction in terms of the atomic absorption coefficient {\$}\backslashalpha{\$} and the critical frequencies is given. From the condition, experimentally verified, that the electrons in the atom for impressed frequencies, large compared to their natural frequencies, shall act like free electrons as far as the index of refraction is concerned, a relation is obtained for {\$}\backslashalpha{\$}. From the failure of this relation when applied to the groups of electrons separately, conclusions are drawn as to the coupling of the groups. Some considerations on the origin of the Compton shifted radiation are added, from which it appears that in the wave description this radiation must be regarded as coming from all the atoms and as being coherent with the incident waves; a result suited to stress the difficulty of harmonizing the wave picture with that of quantum processes in the atoms.1},

abstract = {To fully exploit the ultimate source properties of the next-generation light sources, such as free-electron lasers (FELs) and diffraction-limited storage rings (DLSRs), the quality requirements for gratings and reflective synchrotron optics, especially mirrors, have significantly increased. These coherence-preserving optical components for high-brightness sources will feature nanoscopic shape accuracies over macroscopic length scales up to 1000 mm. To enable high efficiency in terms of photon flux, such optics will be coated with application-tailored single or multilayer coatings. Advanced thin-film fabrication of today enables the synthesis of layers on the sub-nanometre precision level over a deposition length of up to 1500 mm. Specifically dedicated metrology instrumentation of comparable accuracy has been developed to characterize such optical elements. Second-generation slope-measuring profilers like the nanometre optical component measuring machine (NOM) at the BESSY-II Optics laboratory allow the inspection of up to 1500 mm-long reflective optical components with an accuracy better than 50 nrad r.m.s. Besides measuring the shape on top of the coated mirror, it is of particular interest to characterize the internal material properties of the mirror coating, which is the domain of X-rays. Layer thickness, density and interface roughness of single and multilayer coatings are investigated by means of X-ray reflectometry. In this publication recent achievements in the field of slope measuring metrology are shown and the characterization of different types of mirror coating demonstrated. Furthermore, upcoming challenges to the inspection of ultra-precise optical components designed to be used in future FEL and DLSR beamlines are discussed.},

We report on the full characterization of a nanofocused XFEL beam by ptychographic imaging, giving access to the complex wave field in the nanofocus.

The 518 m circumference contains 20 straight sections of alternating 6 and 7 meters in length, to be used for insertion devices as well as injection and RF sys- tems.

This high field dipole (2.0 T) will be made of permanent magnet material, whereas the low field (0.58 T) ones, responsible for the main beam deflection, will be electromagnetic.

abstract = {We report on high resolution measurements of resonances in the spectrum of coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) at the Canadian Light Source (CLS). The resonances permeate the spectrum at wavenumber intervals of {\$}0.074 {\~{}}\backslashtextrm{\{}cm{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}, and are highly stable under changes in the machine setup (energy, bucket filling pattern, CSR in bursting or continuous mode). Analogous resonances were predicted long ago in an idealized theory as eigenmodes of a smooth toroidal vacuum chamber driven by a bunched beam moving on a circular orbit. A corollary of peaks in the spectrum is the presence of pulses in the wakefield of the bunch at well defined spatial intervals. Through experiments and further calculations we elucidate the resonance and wakefield mechanisms in the CLS vacuum chamber, which has a fluted form much different from a smooth torus. The wakefield is observed directly in the 30-110 GHz range by RF diodes, and indirectly by an interferometer in the THz range. The wake pulse sequence found by diodes is less regular than in the toroidal model, and depends on the point of observation, but is accounted for in a simulation of fields in the fluted chamber. Attention is paid to polarization of the observed fields, and possible coherence of fields produced in adjacent bending magnets. Low frequency wakefield production appears to be mainly local in a single bend, but multi-bend effects cannot be excluded entirely, and could play a role in high frequency resonances. New simulation techniques have been developed, which should be invaluable in further work.},

abstract = {Coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) fields are generated when a bunched beam moves along a curved trajectory. A new code, named CSRZ, was developed using finite difference method to calculate the longitudinal CSR impedance for a beam moving along a curved chamber. The method adopted in the code was originated by Agoh and Yokoya [Phys. Rev. ST Accel. Beams 7 (2004) 054403]. It solves the parabolic equation in the frequency domain in a curvilinear coordinate system. The chamber considered has uniform rectangular cross-section along the beam trajectory. The code was used to investigate the properties of CSR impedance of a single or a series of bending magnets. The calculation results indicate that the shielding effect due to outer chamber wall can be well explained by a simple optical approximation model at high frequencies. The CSR fields reflected by the outer wall may interfere with each other along a series of bending magnets and lead to sharp narrow peaks in the CSR impedance. In a small storage ring, such interference effect can be significant and may cause microwave instability, according to a simple estimate of instability threshold.},

abstract = {this thesis is to design and optimize the RF-gun to achieve electron bunch length in femtosecond scale. Starting from the Stanford SUNSHINE design, the RF-gun has been optimized and constructed. These studies were performed by numerical simulation using the codes SUPERFISH and PARMELA. Systematic simulation studies were carried out to investigate the fundamental and practical limits in reducing the electron bunch length. The numerical studies include bunch length dispersion due to focusing in the transport system leading to a final bunch length of some 53 fs with a bunch charge of 94 pCb giving a peak current of 707 A. The RF-gun was constructed based on simulation results. Low-power RF measurements were performed and the results shows that the resonant frequency of the RF-gun is 2855.3 MHz at 25oC in ambient air, which can be tuned to 2856 MHz by adjusting the RF-gun temperature, and the quality factor is 12979 with the RF-coupling coefficient of about 7.5. The RF-gun and other components have been installed at the SURIYA project. The experimental results show that the electron beam of 2-2.5 MeV maximum kinetic energy and a beam current up to 1 A can be obtained from the RF-gun with input power of 3.65 MW. Electron bunches as short as 53 fs can be converted into broad band co- herent radiation in the high-intensity far-infrared (FIR) regime at wavelengths of 50-1000 µm. To verify the simulation results, a transition radiation experimental station to produce FIR transition radiation has been installed. Recently, the FIR signal from transition radiation was successfully observed and verified for the first time at SURIYA laboratory by using room temperature pyroelectric detector.},

We then show that various predictions of the theory agree quite well with results from particle tracking simulations, including the threshold current for transverse instability and the profile of the unstable mode.

abstract = {Harmonic cavity systems have been installed on several 3rd generation light sources to lengthen the bunches and increase the Touschek lifetime. Apart from this beneficial effect, harmonic cavities are known to increase the transient beam loading in high-current machines, due to the presence of gaps in the fill pattern. The amplitude of this effect, which is substantially larger than that caused by the main RF system, can in turn produce considerable variations in bunch length and phase along the train, which result in a significant reduction of the lifetime increase. We have developed a tracking simulation, which we have applied to the analysis of the beam loading transients in Diamond, for the case of passive superconducting harmonic cavities. The influence of beam current, gap amplitude and harmonic cavity tuning on the final lifetime have been studied, as well as the effects of different coupling factors.},

abstract = {The equations of motion of the particles in a synchrotron in which the field gradient index n=−(rB)∂B∂r varies along the equilibrium orbit are examined on the basis of the linear approximation. It is shown that if n alternates rapidly between large positive and large negative values, the stability of both radial and vertical oscillations can be greatly increased compared to conventional accelerators in which n is azimuthally constant and must lie between 0 and 1. Thus aperture requirements are reduced. For practical designs, the improvement is limited by the effects of constructional errors; these lead to resonance excitation of oscillations and consequent instability if 2$\nu$x or 2$\nu$z or $\nu$x + $\nu$z is integral, where $\nu$x and $\nu$z are the frequencies of horizontal and vertical betatron oscillations, measured in units of the frequency of revolution. The mechanism of phase stability is essentially the same as in a conventional synchrotron, but the radial amplitude of synchrotron oscillations is reduced substantially. Furthermore, at a “transition energy” E1 ≈ $\nu$xMc2 the stable and unstable equilibrium phases exchange roles, necessitating a jump in the phase of the radiofrequency accelerating voltage. Calculations indicate that the manner in which this jump is performed is not very critical.},

abstract = {This paper gives an overview of collective effects that are likely to appear and possibly limit the performance in a diffraction-limited storage ring (DLSR) that stores a high-intensity ultra-low-emittance beam. Beam instabilities and other intensity-dependent effects that may significantly impact the machine performance are covered. The latter include beam-induced machine heating, Touschek scattering, intra-beam scattering, as well as incoherent tune shifts. The general trend that the efforts to achieve ultra-low emittance result in increasing the machine coupling impedance and the beam sensitivity to instability is reviewed. The nature of coupling impedance in a DLSR is described, followed by a series of potentially dangerous beam instabilities driven by the former, such as resistive-wall, TMCI (transverse mode coupling instability), head{\{}--{\}}tail and microwave instabilities. In addition, beam-ion and CSR (coherent synchrotron radiation) instabilities are also treated. Means to fight against collective effects such as lengthening of the bunch with passive harmonic cavities and bunch-by-bunch transverse feedback are introduced. Numerical codes developed and used to evaluate the machine coupling impedance, as well as to simulate beam instability using the former as inputs are described.},

abstract = {The coupling impedance of beam tubes is a long-standing important topic for particle accelerators that many authors have addressed. The present study was initiated in view of a specific problem, but its novel approach is broadly applicable to the longitudinal and transverse coupling impedances of coated beam tubes or multilayer tubes. The matrix method presented here derives the wall impedance by treating the radial wave propagation of the beam-excited electromagnetic fields in full analogy to longitudinal transmission lines. Starting from the Maxwell equations, the radially transverse magnetic field compo- nents are described for monopole and dipole modes by a 22 matrix. Assuming isotropic material properties within one layer, the transverse field components at the inner boundary of a layer uniquely are determined by matrix transfer of the field components at its outer boundary. By imposing power-flow constraints on the matrix, wave impedance mapping and field matching between layers is enforced and replaced by matrix multiplication. The longitudinal and transverse coupling impedances are derived from the wall impedance at the innermost boundary, and the different procedures for its determination are discussed. The matrix method is demonstrated via selected yet representative examples of the well-documented cases of a stainless-steel tube, and of a graphite collimator.},

abstract = {The transverse electromagnetic interaction of an intense azimuthally uniform beam of particles with itself, including the effect of a resistive vacuum tank, is investigated theoretically. It is shown that a beam of particles all having velocity v is unstable against the development of transverse waves having a phase velocity close to (1-v/n)v, where v is the number of transverse free betatron oscillations occurring in one revolution and n is a positive integer greater than v. The growth rate for the instability is proportional to N jut, where N is the number of particles in the beam and u is the conductivity of the surface material of the vacuum tank. Stabilizing mechanisms are examined by means of the Vlasov equatIon and it is shown that a spread in the quantity (n-v)v, evaluated for particles in the unperturbed beam, will prevent the instability. A criterion for the spread required is shown, in the limit of walls at high conductivity, to depend upon the beam intensity and energy as well as upon certain geometrical properties of the accelerator, but not upon the conductivity. Numerical examples covering a range of particle accelerators are presented, and suggest that the theory is in agreement with the coherent beam behavior recently observed in a number of accelerators.},

This approximation neglects diffraction effects in the radiation process, and is conceptually equivalent to the approximation of geometric optics in electromagnetic theory. Using this approximation, we derive equations for the longitudinal impedance for arbitrary offsets, with respect to a reference orbit, of source and test particles. With the help of the Panofsky-Wenzel theorem we also obtain expressions for the transverse impedance (also for arbitrary offsets). We further simplify these expressions for the case of the small offsets that are typical for practical applications. Our final expressions for the impedance, in the general case, involve two dimensional integrals over various cross-sections of the transition. We further demonstrate, for several known axisymmetric examples, how our method is applied to the calculation of impedances. Finally, we discuss the accuracy of the optical approximation and its relation to the diffraction regime in the theory of impedance.},

The main radiation source of MAX IV will be a 528multralow emittance storage ring operated at 3 GeV for the generation of high-brightness hard x rays. This storage ring was designed to meet the requirements of state-of-the-art insertion devices which will be installed in nineteen 5 m long dispersion-free straight sections. The storage ring is based on a novel multibend achromat design delivering an unprecedented horizontal bare lattice emittance of 0.33 nm rad and a vertical emittance below the 8 pmrad diffraction limit for 1 A ˚ radiation. In this paper we present the beam dynamics considerations behind this storage-ring design and detail its expected unique performance.},

abstract = {In anticipation of a new era of synchrotron radiation sources based on energy recovery linac techniques, we designed, built, and tested a short undulator magnet prototype whose features make optimum use of the unique conditions expected in these facilities. The prototype has pure permanent magnet (PPM) structure with 24 mm period, 5 mm diameter round gap, and is 30 cm long. In comparison with conventional undulator magnets it has the following: (i) full x-ray polarization control.—It may generate varying linear polarized as well as left and right circular polarized x rays with photon flux much higher than existing Apple-II–type devices. (ii) 40{\%} stronger magnetic field in linear and approximately 2 times stronger in circular polarization modes. This advantage translates into higher x-ray flux. (iii) Compactness.—The prototype can be enclosed in a ?20 cm diameter cylindrical vacuum vessel. These advantages were achieved through a number of unconventional approaches. Among them is control of the magnetic field strength via longitudinal motion of the magnet arrays. The moving mechanism is also used for x-ray polarization control. The compactness is achieved using a recently developed permanent magnet soldering technique for fastening PM blocks. We call this device a ‘‘Delta'' undulator after the shape of its PM blocks. The presented article describes the design study, various aspects of the construction, and presents some test results.},

Computer code GdfidL is used for the estimate of impedances in some of above structures. A new method for measurement of transverse coupling impedance has been used. The method is based on measuring of closed orbit deviation caused by localized impedance. Transverse impedance acts on the beam as a defocusing quadrupole, strength of which depends on the beam current. If a local bump of closed orbit has been created at the impedance location, then the orbit deviation occurs while varying the beam current. The local impedance can be evaluated using the orbit deviation measured. The results of the measurements and numerical calculations are presented and compared.},

Even though the operational difficulties re- lated to these unstable modes were successfully overcome by means of a combination of cavity tuning (using temper- ature and plunger adjustments) with phase modulation of the RF fields at the second harmonic of the synchrotron fre- quency, a more appropriate technique to avoid those prob- lems is the use of higher harmonic cavities, which have the important advantage of providing damping of the longitu- dinal modes without increasing the energy spread. In this work we present the design of a passive higher harmonic cavity (HHC) system optimized for operation at the LNLS storage ring. The parameters for a set of cavities as well as the analysis of some of the effects that they may introduce in the beam dynamics are presented.},

In order to understand the contribution of the vacuum chambers and its dependence on the gap, the distribution of the vertical transverse impedance around the circumference of the APS storage ring has been determined using the response matrix fit method. This method allows us to find focusing errors around the storage ring and was originally used to determine and correct the linear model of the APS. The high accuracy of the method enables us to measure the variation of betatron phase advance around the ring with beam current. Results of these measurements are reported and the impedance of different parts of the storage ring is presented.},

abstract = {The effect of finite resistance in the vacuum-tank walls on the longitudinal stability of an intense beam of particles in an accelerator is investigated theoretically. We show that even if the particle frequency is an increasing function of particle energy, the wall resistance can render the beam unstable against longitudinal bunching. In the absence of frequency spread in the unperturbed beam, the instability occurs with a growth rate that is proportional to (N /u)t, where N is the number of particles in the beam and u is the conductivity of the surface material. By means of the Vlasov equation a criterion for beam stability is obtained. In the limit of highly conducting walls the criterion involves the frequency spread in the unperturbed beam, the number of particles N, the beam energy, geometrical properties of the accelerator, but not the conductivity u. A numerical example presented indicates that certain observations of beam behavior in the MURA 40 MeV electron accelerator may be related to the phenomenon we investigated.},

abstract = {A method is presented for determining the stability of a system consisting of several highly relativistic bunches of charged particles circulating in a storage ring. The particles interact with magnets designed to guide the beam as well as with electromagnetic fields induced by the particles themselves. Previous work has considered modes where all bunches in the ring are executing the same type of internal oscillation. This dissertation considers the results of allowing those modes to couple to one another. The formalism begins with a self- consistent distribution, and analyzes small perturbations to that distribution to determine if they grow exponentially. The formalism allows one to do this computation for an arbitrary magnetic lattice, as well as an arbitrary distribution of wakefield sources around the ring. The method also allows for the inclusion of a feedback system which is designed to damp multibunch oscillations. The PEP-II B-factory with a linear lattice is used as an example to demonstrate and explain the phenomenology that results from this coupling of multibunch modes. The effect of adding feedback is also explored.},

abstract = {We present calculations of collective instability effects Table I: Main Parameters of the MAX IV 3 GeV Ring in the 3 GeV electron storage ring of the MAX IV facility currently under construction in Lund, Sweden. The Circumference 528 m storage ring is designed to deliver ultra-low emittance down to 0.24 nm rad so as to provide high brightness synchrotron radiation from undulators. This is achieved in a comparatively small machine (528 m circumference) through the use of a multi-bend achromat lattice and a compact magnet design with multi-purpose narrow gap magnet blocks. This design features small dispersion leading to low momentum compaction, which, together with the small circular (11 mm radius) chambers, poses a challenge to reach the design current (500 mA in 176 bunches) without exciting instabilities and degrading beam parameters due to the interaction with the machine impedance. Particularly important are multi-bunch resistive wall effects in the NEG coated copper chamber as well single-bunch instabilities driven by the broad-band impedance. A low RF frequency (100 MHz) and harmonic cavities are foreseen to lengthen the bunches and increase instability thresholds.},

@article{Migliorati2015,
abstract = {The simulation of beam dynamics in the presence of collective effects requires a strong computational effort to take into account, in a self-consistent way, the wakefield acting on a given charge and produced by all the others. Generally this is done by means of a convolution integral or sum. Moreover, if the electromagnetic fields consist of resonant modes with high quality factors, responsible, for example, for coupled bunch instabilities, a charge is also affected by itself in previous turns, and a very long record of wakefield must be properly taken into account. In this paper we present a new simulation code for the longitudinal beam dynamics in a circular accelerator, which exploits an alternative approach to the currently used convolution sum, reducing the computing time and avoiding the issues related to the length of wakefield for coupled bunch instabilities.With this approach it is possible to simulate, without the need for large computing power, simultaneously, the single and multibunch beam dynamics including intrabunch motion. Moreover, for a given machine, generally both the coupling impedance and the wake potential of a short Gaussian bunch are known. However, a classical simulation code needs in input the so- called “Green” function, that is the wakefield produced by a point charge, making necessary some manipulations to use the wake potential instead of the Green function. The method that we propose does not need the wakefield as input, but a particular fitting of the coupling impedance requiring the use of the resonator impedance model, thus avoiding issues related to the knowledge of the Green function. The same approach can also be applied to the transverse case and to linear accelerators as well.},

On the other hand, no general algorithm for indirect wakefield integration exists in the literature. In this report we review the known indirect methods to compute wake potentials in rotationally symmetric and cavitylike three-dimensional structures. We present several extensions to the existing techniques and then derive a new general indirect method for arbitrary three-dimensional structures.

abstract = {Kicker magnets are usually significant contributors to the beam coupling impedance of particle accelerators. An accurate understanding of their impedance is required in order to correctly assess the machine intensity limitations. The field matching method derived by H. Tsutsui for the longitudinal and transverse dipolar (driving) impedance of simple models of kickers in the ultrarelativistic regime was already extended to the non-ultrarelativistic case, and to the quadrupolar (detuning) impedance in the ultrarelativistic case. This contribution presents the extension to the quadrupolar impedance in the non-ultrarelativistic case, as well as benchmarks with other available methods to compute the impedance. In particular, all the components of the impedances are benchmarked with (1) Tsutsui's model, i.e. in the ultrarelativistic limit, (2) the model for the flat chamber impedance recently computed by N. Mounet and E. M{\'{e}}tral, in the case of finite relativistic gamma, and with (3) CST Particle Studio simulations.},

To get complete and reliable information of the impedance, numerical simulation and beam-based measurement have been performed. The impedance of an existing ID taper geometrically similar to the new one has been measured using the orbit bump method. It turns out that in spite of the small magnitude (few $\mu$m) of orbit distortion to be observed in this case, the BPM resolution is sufficient for this measurement. The measurement results in comparison with simulation data are discussed in this paper.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the brightness and coherence proper- ties of radiation from storage rings and free electron lasers (FELs). Starting from the statistical optics and using mu- tual coherence function of the radiation field, we define the transverse and temporal coherence and modes. Spec- tral brightness can be represented in radiation phase-space via the Wigner function which is the Fourier transforma- tion of the transverse correlation function. The brightness convolution theorem can be employed to calculate the to- tal source brightness and the degree of transverse coher- ence of the radiation emitted by an electron beam. Undu- lator radiation possesses partial transverse coherence until the beam emittances can be reduced below the diffraction limit. For x-ray FELs the radiation has excellent transverse coherence and at least 9 orders of magnitude enhancement in peak brightness. Seeding can further improve temporal coherence of FELs. Future development includes diffrac- tion limited light sources, higher peak and average power x-ray FELs and compact coherent radiation sources based on laser and plasma accelerators.},

abstract = {High-power, pulsed, coherent, far-infrared (FIR) radiation has many scientific applications, such as pump-probe studies of surfaces, liquids, and solids, studies of high-Tc, superconductors, biophysics, plasma diagnostics, and excitation of Rydberg atoms. Few sources of such FIR radiation currently exist. Superradiant undulator radiation produced at the SUNSHINE (Stanford UNiversity SHort INtense Electron-source) is such a FIR source. First proposed in the mm-wave spectral range by Motz, superradiant undulator radiation has been realized in the 45 um to 300 um spectral range by using sub-picosecond electron bunches produced by the SUNSHINE facility. The experimental setup and measurements of this FIR radiation are reported in this thesis. In addition to being a useful FIR source, the superradiant undulator radiation produced at SUNSHINE is an object of research in itself. Measured superlinear growth of the radiated energy along the undulator demonstrates the self-amplification of radiation by the electron bunch. This superlinear growth is seen at 47 um to 70 um wavelengths. These wavelengths are an order of magnitude shorter than in previous self-amplification demonstrations.},

@article{Tavares2014,
abstract = {The MAX IV storage rings, currently under construction in Lund, Sweden, will use third harmonic cavities operated passively to lengthen the bunches and alleviate collective instabilities. These cavities are an essential ingredient in the MAX IV design concept and are required for achieving the final design goals in terms of stored current, beam emittance, and beam lifetime—such performance challenges are in fact common to all recent ultralow emittance storage ring designs and harmonic cavities are currently under consideration in several laboratories. In this paper, we report on parametric studies comparing different harmonic cavity settings in terms of the resulting bunch length, peak bunch density, and incoherent synchrotron frequency spread for the MAX IV 3 GeV ring. The equilibrium longitudinal bunch density distribution was calculated by establishing a self-consistent equation for the bunch form factor, describing the bunch shape. The calculations are fully self-consistent in the sense that not only the amplitude but also the phase of the waves excited by the beam in the harmonic cavity were assumed to be a function of the bunch shape, which allowed us to explore a wide parameter range not restricted to the region close to the conditions for which the first and second derivatives of the total rf voltage are zero at the synchronous phase. Our results indicate that up to a factor 5 increase in rms bunch length is achievable with a purely passive system for theMAXIV 3 GeV ring while keeping a relatively large harmonic cavity detuning, thus limiting the unavoidable Robinson antidamping rate from the fundamental mode of a passively operated harmonic cavity to values below the synchrotron radiation damping rate. The paper is complemented by results of measurements performed in the MAX III storage ring, which showed good agreement with calculations following the fully self-consistent approach.},

abstract = {this thesis is to design and optimize the RF-gun to achieve electron bunch length in femtosecond scale. Starting from the Stanford SUNSHINE design, the RF-gun has been optimized and constructed. These studies were performed by numerical simulation using the codes SUPERFISH and PARMELA. Systematic simulation studies were carried out to investigate the fundamental and practical limits in reducing the electron bunch length. The numerical studies include bunch length dispersion due to focusing in the transport system leading to a final bunch length of some 53 fs with a bunch charge of 94 pCb giving a peak current of 707 A. The RF-gun was constructed based on simulation results. Low-power RF measurements were performed and the results shows that the resonant frequency of the RF-gun is 2855.3 MHz at 25oC in ambient air, which can be tuned to 2856 MHz by adjusting the RF-gun temperature, and the quality factor is 12979 with the RF-coupling coefficient of about 7.5. The RF-gun and other components have been installed at the SURIYA project. The experimental results show that the electron beam of 2-2.5 MeV maximum kinetic energy and a beam current up to 1 A can be obtained from the RF-gun with input power of 3.65 MW. Electron bunches as short as 53 fs can be converted into broad band co- herent radiation in the high-intensity far-infrared (FIR) regime at wavelengths of 50-1000 µm. To verify the simulation results, a transition radiation experimental station to produce FIR transition radiation has been installed. Recently, the FIR signal from transition radiation was successfully observed and verified for the first time at SURIYA laboratory by using room temperature pyroelectric detector.},

abstract = {The MAX IV facility includes two storage rings operated at 1.5 GeV and 3 GeV. Both rings make use of a 100 MHz RF system and are designed to operate with a uniform multi- bunch fill pattern aswell as employ passive harmonic cavities to damp instabilities and increase Touschek lifetime. Re- cently, a discussion on timing modes at theMAXIV storage rings has been initiated by the user community. This implies operating the rings with other fill patterns than the originally planned multibunch mode and therefore detailed studies of the performance of the harmonic cavities are of interest. This paper presents bunch length measurements at the 100 MHz MAX II storage ring for uniform fill patterns. The purpose of the measurements was to evaluate the employed measure- ment method and simulation codes for future studies of fill patterns in the MAX IV storage rings.},

The latter allows for time-frequency representations where the bandwidths can be e.g. constant on the log-frequency scale (constant Q) or constant on the auditory critical-band scale (smoothly varying Q).

Besides the features that stem from [3] – perfect reconstruction and computational efficiency – we propose here a technique for computing coefficient phases in a way that makes their interpretation more natural.

abstract = {The ASTeC Vacuum Science Group has an ongoing study for the improvement of the nonevaporable getter (NEG) coatings currently used in many accelerators around the world. The main advantages of using NEG coatings are evenly distributed pumping speed, low thermal outgassing rates, and low photon-stimulated gas desorption and electron-stimulated gas desorption (ESD). Previously, it was shown that the dense NEG coating provides lower ESD compared to that of a columnar film, but its pumping properties are reduced. This paper describes the results for a dual layer of NEG where a dense layer was deposited first and a columnar layer was then deposited on top. In such a dual-layer NEG coating, the dense layer acted as a barrier for hydrogen diffusion and the columnar layer further reduced the ESD of hydrogen and provided improved pumping properties. An alloy target of Ti-Zr-Hf-V was used to deposit a 0.5 lm-thick layer of the dense NEG followed by a 1 lm-thick columnar structure of NEG onto the inner surface of a 50-cm long stainless steel tube. The composition and the structure of the dual layer were determined by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. The NEG vacuum performance was tested using the ESD and pumping properties, which were measured on a dedi- cated in-house designed facility.},

The applicability of the PE in the high-frequency limit is based on the observation that in this case the contribution to impedance comes from the electromagneticwaves that catch up with the beam far from the obstacle and propagate at small angles to the axis of the pipe. One of the most important advantages of the PE is that it eliminates the spatial scale of the smallwavelength from the problem. As a result, the numerical solution of the PE requires coarser spatial meshes. In this paper we focus on the longitudinal impedance for an axisymmetric geometry and assume a perfect conductivity of the walls.We show how the known analytical results which include a small-angle collimator, step-in and step-out transitions, and a pillbox cavity, can be derived within the framework of the PE.},

The algorithm is implemented in the new parallel tracking code SPACE (self-consistent parallel algorithm for collective effects) discussed in the paper. The code is applicable for accurate beam dynamics simulations in cases where both bunch-to-bunch and intrabunch motions need to be taken into account, such as chromatic head-tail effects on the coupled-bunch instability of a beam with a nonuniform filling pattern, or multibunch and single-bunch effects of a passive higher-harmonic cavity. The numerical simulations have been compared with analytical studies. For a beam with an arbitrary filling pattern, intensity-dependent complex frequency shifts have been derived starting from a system of coupled Vlasov equations. The analytical formulas and numerical simulations confirm that the analysis is reduced to the formulation of an eigenvalue problem based on the known formulas of the complex frequency shifts for the uniform filling pattern case.},

abstract = {The UHV behaviour of stainless steel vacuum chambers, coated ex situ by sputtering with a thin film of a getter material, has been investigated. The purpose of this study was to ascertain if the getter film could be activated after air exposure by in situ baking, so as to transform the vacuum chamber from a gas source into a pump. Many elements and alloys have been tested, all of which could be activated by baking at temperatures acceptable for stainless steel components, i.e. lower than 400°C. In one case (equiatomic TiZr alloy) an activation temperature of 200-250°C has been measured. This investigation has been carried out using Electron Stimulated Desorption, pumping speed and ultimate pressure measurements. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A multibunch beam is found to be under a strong influence of resistive-wall and fast beam-ion instabilities, in a way that largely depends on the local position in a bunch train. For a single bunch, the measured reactive impedance turns out to be larger by nearly a factor of two than calculated in all three planes. The roughness impedance due to NEG coating is assessed as a possible cause.},

If a local bump of closed orbit has been created at the impedance location, then the orbit deviation occurs while varying the beam current. The local impedance can be evaluated using the orbit deviation measured. Measurement technique is described, the method accuracy is evaluated.

@book{Zwanzig2001,
abstract = {My intention in this book is to provide some understanding of the various methods that have been proposed for treating time-dependent processes in statistical mechanics. Some familiarity with equilibrium statistical mechanics is assumed. Whenever possible, I start with a simple example, generalize it, and finally discuss its theoretical foun- dations. The applications treated here were chosen as simple illustra- tions of a particular method; these choices were motivated by their utility in chemical physics. The methods, of course, have a much wider applicability, for example, in biophysics or condensed matter physics or even in astrophysics. There are no problem sets or exercises; most inter- esting problems are suitable subjects for serious research, and there is no point practicing on uninteresting problems. There are few literature references, only the occasional name and date; a lot of the material has been around a long time, and some of it is my own work. In a letter accepting the Rumford medal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1881, J. Willard Gibbs wrote One of the principal objects of theoretical research in any department of knowledge is to find the point of view from which the subject appears in its greatest simplicity. This is a hard standard; I hope that I came close. I am especially indebted to Attila Szabo, who encouraged me to finish a project I started about 1965 and who worked hard to get me to simplify my often obscure treat- ments of various topics. My failures are my own, not his.},

The case of a single bunch is considered in detail and demonstrated to be stable (even in the absence of Landau damp- ing) provided p lies between an integer and the next higher half-integer, where p is the number of transverse free betatron oscillations occurring in one revolution; for many bunches which are sensibly different in intensity (a criterion for this is presented), all modes are stable provided p satisfies the same restriction. For equally spaced bunches of equal numbers of particles, approximately half the modes are unstable without Landau damping. Nu- merical examples are presented covering some intermediate situations.},

In order to understand the contribution of the vacuum chambers and its dependence on the gap, the distribution of the vertical transverse impedance around the circumference of the APS storage ring has been determined using the response matrix fit method. This method allows us to find focusing errors around the storage ring and was originally used to determine and correct the linear model of the APS.

abstract = {elegant (ELEctron Generation ANd Tracking) is the prin- ciple accelerator simulation code used at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) for circular and one-pass machines. Capabilities include 6-D tracking using matrices up to third order, canonical integration, and numerical integration. Standard beamline elements are supported, as well as co- herent synchrotron radiation, wakefields, rf elements, kick- ers, apertures, scattering, and more. In addition to tracking with and without errors, elegant performs optimization of tracked properties, as well as computation and optimiza- tion of Twiss parameters, radiation integrals, matrices, and floor coordinates. Orbit/trajectory, tune, and chromatic- ity correction are supported. elegant is fully compliant with the Self Describing Data Sets [1, 2] (SDDS) file pro- tocol, and hence uses the SDDS Toolkit for pre- and post- processing. This permits users to prepare scripts to run the code in a flexible and automated fashion. It is particularly well suited to multistage simulation and concurrent simu- lation on many workstations. Several examples of complex projects performed with elegant are given, including top- up safety analysis of the APS and design of the APS bunch compressor.},

abstract = {The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) hosted at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research in Geneva, Switzerland, is the world's largest particle accelerator. With a circumference of 27 km, it can bring proton beams into collitions at a centre of mass energy of 14 TeV. It has been conceived and built to let scientific research to explore the high energy physics frontiers, keeping collision events at a design luminiosity of 1034 cm−2s−1. Beyond this goal challenging in itself, the High Luminosity LHC (HiLumi-LHC) project aims at increasing the LHC luminosity by an order of magnitude and one of the key ingredients to achieve that is to increase beam intensity. In order to keep beam instabilities under control and to avoid excessive power losses a careful design of new vacuum chamber components and continuous update and improvement of the LHC impedance model are required. Collimators are among the major impedance contributors. During LHC Run I, measurements with beam have revealed that the betatron coherent tune shifts were higher by about a factor of 2 with respect to the theoretical predictions based on the impedance model up to 2012. In that model the resistive wall impedance was considered as the dominating impedance contribution for collimators. By means of GdfidL electromagnetic code simulations, the geometric impedance of secondary and tertiary (TCS/TCT) collimators' real structures (i.e. not simplified) was calculated, contributing to the update of the LHC impedance model. This resulted also in a better agreement between the measured and simulated betatron tune shifts. During the LHC Long Shutdown I (LS I), some of the Run I TCS and TCT collimators were replaced by new devices, embedding Beam Position Monitor (BPM) pick-up buttons in the tapering regions, in order to provide accurate and continuous measurements of the beam centres, and ferrite blocks for the damping of the Higher Order Modes (HOMs) trapped in the collimators' structure. The injection collimators (TDI) are undergoing a substantial design review and upgrade study stage, as part of the whole LHC injection protection system upgrade foreseen to be finished in the LHC LS II (2018-2019). Measurements performed during LHC Run I have shown that the presently installed TDIs contribute significantly to both longitudinal and transverse impedance, determining beam induced heating and high vacuum pressure that affected background of experiments. In the view of higher intensities planned for the Run III and HiLumi-LHC operations, all these impedance related issues have to be minimized. The aim of this work was to perform accurate simulations of collimators' impedance, which has become very important and challenging. Accurate does mean as close as possible to the real conditions. Thus, in order to afford such a task, the huge collimators' CAD designs were used as input into GdfidL code. Besides, several dedicated tests have been performed to verify correct simulations of lossy dispersive material properties, such as resistive wall and ferrites, benchmarking code results with analytical, semi-analytical and other numerical codes outcomes. The results of the collimators wake fields and impedances calculations, together with their comparison with experimental measurements are shown and discussed.},

abstract = {The SPring-8 upgrade project has adopted the hybrid MBA lattice to achieve the emittance of about 100 pmrad at 6 GeV. This optics has two dispersion bumps in a unit cell where chromaticity-correcting sextupoles locate. The hor- izontal and vertical betatron phases between these bumps are tuned to be about 3$\pi$ and $\pi$, respectively, to cancel the loworder contributionsof nonlinearkicks due to sextupoles. However, it is not easy to obtain a sufficiently large dynamic aperture (DA) since (i) the cancellation is incomplete due to a nested arrangement, (ii) sextupoles are very strong, and (iii) the number of tuning knobs is limited. The DA is quite small due to the leakage of nonlinear kicks by nested sex- tupoles. We hence proposed to install additional weak sex- tupoles between the dispersion bumps to suppress the leak- age kick further. Simulations show that this simple scheme is very effective for suppressing amplitude-dependent tune shift (ADTS) and for enlarging DA.},

abstract = {The Yee finite-difference time domain method (FDTD) is commonly used in wake field and particle-in-cell simulations. However, in accelerator modeling the high energy particles can travel in vacuum faster than their own radiation. This effect is commonly referred to as numerical Cherenkov radiation and is a consequence of numerical grid dispersion. Several numerical approaches are proposed to reduce the dispersion for all angles and for a given frequency range, that justifies itself for domains big in all three directions. On the contrary, in accelerator modeling the transverse dimensions and transverse beam velocity are small, but it is extremely important to eliminate the dispersion error in the well-defined direction of the beam motion for all frequencies. In this paper we propose a new two-level economical conservative scheme for electromagnetic field calculations in three dimensions. The scheme does not have dispersion in the longitudinal direction and is staircase-free (second order convergent). Unlike the FDTD method, it is based on a “transversal-electric/transversal-magnetic” (TE/TM)-like splitting of the field components in time. The scheme assures energy and charge conservation. Additionally, the usage of damping terms allows suppressing high frequency noise generated due to the transverse dispersion and the current fluctuations. The dispersion relation of the damping scheme is analyzed. As numerical examples show, the new scheme is much more accurate on the long-time scale than the conventional FDTD approach. },

An extensive use of NEG coatings is especially suitable in view of next-generation machines, for which long and small-aperture tubes (i.e., down to 4 mm) are envisaged in order to reach even higher luminosities and lower emittances. Such stringent requirements should be carefully addressed, as a number of technical issues arise—both in terms of coating deposition and characterisation—when dealing with narrow-gap beam pipes of this kind. The use of NEG coating for narrow-gap insertion devices has steadily grown over the past ten years; a review of both current R{\&}D activities and future perspectives in this field is presented, together with an overview of the analytical techniques employed for the characterisation of the film deposited on small-section chambers.

The concerned tune shifts are supposed to arise from the mean quadrupolar wake field induced by the resistive low-gap chambers, which are distributed around the ring for insertion devices. By employing the scheme developed by K. Yokoya, fields are computed for the actual low-gap chambers of the ESRF machine. Effective focusing strengths are then deduced to compute the tune shifts of individual bunches in an arbitrary filling. It is found that the multi-turn effect plays a key role in reproducing the observed tune shift in multibunch fillings. Tune shifts are also expected to be significant in single bunch due to the strong short-range resistive-wall wake field. Experimental evidence of the numerical finding is pursued. The impact to the coherent single bunch tune shifts and hence to the modelling of the broadband impedance is also discussed.},

abstract = {The MAX IV facility, currently under construction in Lund, Sweden, features two electron storage rings operated at 3 GeV and 1.5 GeV and optimized for the hard X-ray and soft X-ray/VUV spectral ranges, respectively. A 3 GeV linear accelerator serves as a full-energy injector into both rings as well as a driver for a short-pulse facility, in which undulators produce X-ray pulses as short as 100 fs. The 3 GeV ring employs a multibend achromat (MBA) lattice to achieve, in a relatively short circumference of 528 m, a bare lattice emittance of 0.33 nm rad, which reduces to 0.2 nm rad as insertion devices are added. The engineering implementation of the MBA lattice raises several technological problems. The large number of strong magnets per achromat calls for a compact design featuring small-gap combined-function magnets grouped into cells and sharing a common iron yoke. The small apertures lead to a low-conductance vacuum chamber design that relies on the chamber itself as a distributed copper absorber for the heat deposited by synchrotron radiation, while non-evaporable getter (NEG) coating provides for reduced photodesorption yields and distributed pumping. Finally, a low main frequency (100 MHz) is chosen for the RF system yielding long bunches, which are further elongated by passively operated third-harmonic Landau cavities, thus alleviating collective effects, both coherent (e.g. resistive wall instabilities) and incoherent (intrabeam scattering). In this paper, we focus on the MAX IV 3 GeV ring and present the lattice design as well as the engineering solutions to the challenges inherent to such a design. As the first realisation of a light source based on the MBA concept, the MAX IV 3 GeV ring offers an opportunity for validation of concepts that are likely to be essential ingredients of future diffraction-limited light sources.},

For machines demanding beams of very low emittance and high stability, such as the damping rings of a future linear collider or the storage rings of a super flavor factory, this could be a potential performance limitation.We present an analysis, for the International Linear Collider (ILC) damping rings, of the transverse jitter induced on the extracted bunches from the jitter on the injected bunches, with the coupling between bunches mediated by the resistive-wall wakefield of the vacuum chamber. We find that it is important to include details of the local transverse focusing around the ring. We consider the impact of the finite thickness of the beam pipe wall, and of nonevaporable getter coating on the inside surface: in the parameter regime of the ILC damping rings, we find that the results are only slightly modified compared to an approximation to the resistive-wall wakefield based on a single-layer wall of infinite thickness. The results from our simulations indicate a tight specification on the jitter of the injected bunches.},

In particular the multimode direct space-charge impedances (both longitudinal and transverse) are given, as well as the wall impedance to any order of precision. New quadrupolar terms for the transverse wall impedance are found, which look negligible in the ultrarelativistic case but might be of significance for low-energy beams.

abstract = {Injection into the two MAX IV storage rings will not make use of a 4-kicker local injection bump. Instead, pulsed multipole injection will be used for initial filling as well as top-up injection. Since commissioning a pulsed multipole magnet for injection into a storage ring is non-trivial, it has been decided to install a single dipole kicker magnet into the storage rings to provide a simple method for injection during early commissioning. Design studies have revealed that injection with a single dipole kicker into the MAX IV storage rings is not only efficient, but also allows for accumulation of beam. Although this accumulation cannot be made transparent to users (i.e. it is not compatible with user top-up operation), it does provide a simple and robust injection method during commissioning. In addition, the dipole kicker can be used as a pinger magnet during machine studies with a single-bunch filling. This paper reports on the design studies performed for dipole kicker injection into the MAX IV storage rings and presents a summary of the expected performance of such an injection scheme. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A digi- tal sampling oscilloscope is used to observe the cavity and beam signals simultaneously, and the amplitude and relative phase are obtained from a Fourier transform of the time-domain data. This procedure gives 6 mdeg resolution and is largely insensitive to input signal amplitude variations. The measurement system was used to study the dependence of the synchronous phase shift on beam current, gap voltage, and beam energy in the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Source electron storage ring.},

The resulting integral equation is expanded into a set of orthogonal polynomials, and the expansion coefficients are then given by the solution ofan infinite determinant. Truncation ofthis determinant permits solution ofthe problem on a computer, and a code has been written which finds the complex mode frequencies. The stability limits are determined by equating the imaginary part of the solution to the radiation damping rate. The theory is applied to LEP at injection with third higher-harmonic cavities, and the results were compared with those obtained by the multi-particle simulation program. They show excellent agreement, and predict that the threshold current will be reduced rather than improved.},

For an electron circulating midway between parallel plates, the method of image charges is used to derive the wakefield, exhibit a scaling property and evaluate the scaling functions. As a complement to the time-domain ana- lysis of the wakefield, we discuss its frequency-domain counterpart, the longitudinal coupling impedance.

abstract = {The SPS kickers are major contributors to the SPS trans- verse beam coupling impedance. The current ”flat cham- ber” impedance model for a kicker is obtained by apply- ing form factors to the theoretical impedance of an ax- isymmetric ferrite beam pipe. This model was believed to be acceptable for the vertical dipolar impedance, as two- wire measurements on SPS kickers revealed a satisfactory agreement. However, one-wire measurements on PS kick- ers suggested that this model underestimates the kickers' transverse quadrupolar (detuning) impedance. The longitu- dinal and transverse dipolar impedances of another kicker model that accounts for the metallic plates on each side of the ferrite were derived in the past by H. Tsutsui. The same formalism is used in this paper to derive the quadrupolar impedance. These formulae were then successfully bench- marked to electromagnetic (EM) simulations. Finally, sim- ulating the interaction of an SPS bunch with the improved kickers' model results in a positive horizontal tune shift, which is very close to the tune shift measured with the SPS beam.},

For the example chosen, we are able to obtain results that agree with those from an FFT to within 0.5 per cent in a time that is a factor of 10� shorter. Potential applications of our LFT in geophysics include conversion of wide-band electromagnetic frequency responses to transient responses, glacial loading and unloading, aquifer recharge problems, normal mode and earth tide studies in seismology, and impulsive shock wave modelling.},

Sirius will have a low emittance storage ring, 0.28 nm.rad, based on 20 cells of a highly compact lattice – 5 bend achromat (5BA). This lattice concept leaves very little space for components and therefore requires narrow vacuum chambers with tight mechanical tolerances. Most of the storage ring vacuum chambers will be made of oxygen-free silver bearing (OFS) copper and have a circular cross section with inner diameter of 24 mm and a wall thickness of 1 mm. Unused synchrotron radiation will be distributed along the water cooled walls of the chambers. Due to the small conductance of the chambers, vacuum pumping will be based on distributed concept and then non-evaporable getter (NEG) coating will be extensively used, with more than 95{\%} of the chambers being coated. In this paper, we present an overview of the storage ring vacuum system and the fabrication approach for some components.},

For structures of cylindrical symmetry a computer code named URMEL is described which calculates resonant modes of any azimuthal mode number m = 0, 1, 2... (monopole, dipole, quadrupole, etc.). The eigenfrequencies are found as linear eigenvahies of a large matrix and simple mathematical procedures guarantee that no modes are missed.

abstract = {The resistive wall impedance of cylindrical vacuum chambers was first calculated over 40 years ago. The original results were valid for metal vacuum chamber walls which are thick compared to the skin depth at the frequencies of interest. Recently the subject has again become important for beam stability in the LHC where in particular the transverse impedance of the large number of graphite collimators to be installed could severely limit its performance, if the “thick wall” formulae were correct. The frequencies of the slow betatron waves in such a large machine are very low and thus the transverse impedance, originally found to be proportional to the inverse square root of frequency, could lead to instabilities. However, when the skin depth exceeds the wall thickness, the transverse resistive wall impedance is strongly reduced and a number of papers have recently been published to estimate this reduction. However, all of these had restrictions of validity. Here we give a consistent derivation of the general expression for the transverse impedance of walls made of arbitrary materials which are valid at all frequencies. The results are compared with previous ones in the graphs for the LHC collimators - where they agree quite well, but also for the SPS-MKE kickers which are required for injection into the LHC and where the agreement is less perfect.},

The theory is applied to bunch lengthening observed at SPEAR II. The theory explains qualitative features of the experimental results fairly well, but quantitative agreement is not too good. This is ascribed to our insufficient knowledge of the coupling impedance ofSPEAR II or to the possibility that such effects as radiation damping and quantum excitation should be included.},

abstract = {A gap in the vacuum chamber stands between a beam and the outside world, and the theoretical elucidation of the interaction mechanism between the gap and the beam is of great importance to understand the interaction of any device with the beam. In this paper, we will present the formulas for the longitudinal and transverse impedances due to a gap in the beam chamber. In this process, we will derive the complete solutions of electromagnetic fields effective in the entire region, including the inside and the outside of the chamber, in a form that they can be easily numerically evaluated. The newly developed technique can provide new methods of solutions of electromagnetic fields also for a rather broad class of structures such as cavities. The numerical results of impedances are consistent with the ABCI results and their behavior in high frequency agrees well with the prediction of the diffraction theory. Our theory can also accurately reproduce the behavior of the impedance near and above the cutoff frequencies. In addition, our theory is applicable even to the impedances for nonrelativistic beams. We found that the broadband impedance of the small cavitylike structure can be estimated from the gap size and the chamber radius only, regardless of the exact shape of the structure.We also found that the transverse impedance of a gap has a large resonance peak at the frequency where the wavelength is equal to the chamber circumference. This resonance peak appears around 1–2 GHz in most of the cases, and we should be careful to design a ceramic break so that this transverse mode will not leak out to interact with nearby devices.},

@article{Chin2016,
abstract = {In this paper, we present a new two particle model for studying the strong head-tail instabilities in the presence of the space-charge force. It is a simple expansion of the well-known two particle model for strong head-tail instability and is still analytically solvable. No chromaticity effect is included. It leads to a formula for the growth rate as a function of the two dimensionless parameters: the space-charge tune shift parameter (normalized by the synchrotron tune) and the wakefield strength, ϒ. The three-dimensional contour plot of the growth rate as a function of those two dimensionless parameters reveals stopband structures. Many simulation results generally indicate that a strong head-tail instability can be damped by a weak space- charge force, but the beam becomes unstable again when the space-charge force is further increased. The newtwo particle model indicates a similar behavior. In weak space-charge regions, additional tune shifts by the space-charge force dissolve the mode coupling. As the space-charge force is increased, they conversely restore the mode coupling, but then a further increase of the space-charge force decouples the modes again. This mode coupling/decoupling behavior creates the stopband structures.},

Our approach does not require a symmetry axis in the system (unlike round geometry). We show that the calculation of the impedance reduces to finding a few auxiliary potential functions that satisfy two-dimensional Poisson equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions. In simple cases such solutions can be obtained analytically; for more complicated geometries they can easily be found numerically.We apply our method to axisymmetric geometry and reproduce results known from the literature. We then calculate the impedance of a taper with rectangular cross section in which the vertical dimension of the cross section is a slowly changing function of the longitudinal coordinate. Finally, we find a transverse kick experienced by a beam passing near a conducting wall with a variable distance from the beam to the wall.},

We present also our version of the diffraction model of the high-frequency impedance of the cavity, a model originally suggested by Lawson. This model predicts a longitudinal impedance that varies as w-1I2 and a transverse impedance that varies as W-3/2 at high frequencies, with their ratio equal to wa2/(2c), where a is the radius of the beam tube.

Three distinct ranges of the excited field are studied: the long multiturn regime in multibunch fillings, the medium regime involving neighboring bunches, and the short intrabunch regime. Two theoretical models, which both take into account the field diffusion across chamber walls of finite thickness, are employed to compare the measurement with theoretical expectations. Specific experimental methods, based respectively upon orbit analysis, bunch-by-bunch transverse feedback and a single particle betatron resonance, are introduced to measure the incoherent focusing effect in the three regimes. It is found that the excited incoherent fields can be large enough to affect the ring performance. The non-negligible contribution of nonevaporable getter coating is shown to improve the agreement between measurements and calculations.},

It relies on expressing the wake potentials, of any multipole order, as integrals over the e.m. fields along an arbitrary one-dimensional contour spanning the structure longitudinally. For perfectly conducting structures, the integration along the axis can then be replaced by choosing a contour beginning and ending on the beam tubes. Thus it generalizes the former method of calculating the wake potentials by integrating along a straight line at the beam tube radius. Its usefulness is illustrated with the computer code ABCI which permits calculation of wake potentials in structures extending to the inside of the beam tube radius, or having unequal beam tube radii at the two sides. ?? 1993.},

abstract = {In this thesis, the problemof the transverse coupled-bunch instabilities created by the LargeHadron Collider (LHC) beam-coupling impedance, that can possibly limit the machine operation, is addressed thanks to several new theories and tools. A rather complete vision of the problemis proposed here, going fromthe calculation of the impedances and wake functions of individual machine elements, to the beam dynamics study. Firstly, new results are obtained in the theory of the beam-coupling impedance for an axisymmetric two-dimensional structure, generalizing Zotter's theories, and a new general theory is derived for the impedance of an infinite flat two-dimensional structure. Then, a new approach has been found to compute thewake functions fromsuch analytically obtained beam-coupling impedances, over- coming limitations that could be met with standard discrete Fourier transformprocedures. Those results are then used to obtain an impedance andwake function model of the LHC, based on the (resistive-) wall impedances of various contributors (collimators, beamscreens and vacuumpipe) and additional estimations of the geometrical impedance contributions. Finally, the existing code HEADTAIL,which is a macroparticle simulation code for beam dynamics studies with wake fields, is improved to make possible the simulation ofmultibunch trains, and a spectral analysis technique is found to facilitate the analysis of the output given by this code, giving the complex tune shifts of the unstable modes present in a simulation. All those theories and tools are used to obtain new results concerning the LHC transverse coupled-bunch instabilities, demonstrating the rather small impact on coupled-bunch instabilities of the number of bunches in a train when the bunch spacing is fixed, and the existence of coupled-bunch modes with intrabunch motion which are more critical than their single-bunch counterparts. A full verification of the complete procedure (impedance theories, impedance model and simulation code) is also performed by comparing the simulation results with actualmeasurements in the LHC, giving a very good agreement at injection energy and a correct order ofmagnitude at 3.5 TeV/c. In the end, several predictions concerning the beam stability at the future 7 TeV/c operation of the machine are performed in the case of 50 ns spacing (1404 bunches), revealing that the coupled-bunch transverse mode coupling instability threshold is far above the ultimate bunch intensity but about 20{\%} smaller than its single-bunch counterpart. Stability studies with Landau octupoles at their maximumcurrents reveal that the beam remains stable at nominal intensity withQ? =2 in both planes, provided the particle transverse distributions are Gaussian. At ultimate intensity with eitherQ? =0 orQ? =2, or at nominal intensitywhen the chromaticity is zero, the beam happens to be unstable, even with the octupoles at theirmaximumcurrents.},

abstract = {It has been known for decades that the emittance of multi-GeV storage rings can be reduced to very small values using multi-bend achromat (MBA) lattices. However, a practical design of a ring having emittance approaching the diffraction limit for multi-keV photons, i.e. a diffraction-limited storage ring (DLSR), with a circumference of order 1 km or less was not possible before the development of small-aperture vacuum systems and other accelerator technology, together with an evolution in the understanding and accurate simulation of non-linear beam dynamics, had taken place. The 3-GeV MAX IV project in Sweden has initiated a new era of MBA storage ring light source design, i.e. a fourth generation, with the Sirius project in Brazil now following suit, each having an order of magnitude smaller horizontal emittance than third-generation machines. The ESRF, APS and SPring-8 are all exploring 6-GeV MBA lattice conversions in the imminent future while China is considering a similar-energy green-field machine. Other lower-energy facilities, including the ALS, SLS, Soleil, Diamond and others, are studying the possibility of such conversions. Future larger-circumference rings, possibly housed in {\textgreater}2-km tunnels made available by decommissioned high-energy physics accelerators, could have sub-10-pm-rad emittances, providing very high coherence for {\textgreater}10-keV X-rays.

Simulation results for the case of coherent synchrotron radiation will be compared to measurements that probe the effects of the micro-bunching instability occurring in the short bunch operation at ANKA.

abstract = {We present an explanation for the opposite signs of the horizontal and vertical tune shifts of bunch trains which have been observed recently in several high-energy storage rings. This result can be understood in terms of the long-range quadrupolar wakes of noncircular vacuum chambers with finite resistivity. In vacuum chambers with circular cross section, the dominant transverse wake driven by a leading particle and seen by a trailing test particle is dipolar and is proportional only to the transverse offset of the driving particle. The contributions of preceding bunches or previous turns tend to cancel, as they add with oscillatory factors. On the other hand, quadrupolar wakes are independent of the offset of the driving particle, and thus the contributions of preceding bunches and turns are strictly additive. Since quadrupole fields are focusing in one plane and defocusing in the plane orthogonal to it, their effects on tune shifts in these planes have opposite signs. Their cumulative effect also explains the large values of the tune shifts measured in PEP-II, which exceeded estimates from other impedance sources by factors of 3 to 4. Our analysis also offers a connection to the familiar Laslett tune shift.},

abstract = {In an x-ray free electron laser like the Linear Coherent Light Source being designed at SLAC, electron bunches about 70 mm FWHM long are sent into a beam tube only 5 mm in internal diameter and more than 100 m in length. Because of the surface roughness of the beam tube, wakefields can be generated that catch up to the bunch and interact with it, causing energy spread and emittance growth. The strength of this effect depends on the details of the roughness of the surface. We present here a study in which the roughness of the beam tube was measured and the longitudinal impedance of the tube was calculated. Our result shows that a commercially available beam tube can be made smooth enough so the resulting wakefield effects are within the tolerance determined by the requirement that the induced relative energy spread of the beam be less than 5 3 1024.},

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the electromagnetic interaction between a point charge travelling inside a waveguide of elliptical cross section, and the waveguide itself. By using a convenient expansion of the Mathieu functions, useful in particular for treating a variety of problems in applied mathematics and physics with elliptic geometry, we first obtain the longitudinal electromagnetic field of a point charge (Green's function) in free space in terms of elliptical coordinates. This expression allows, then, to calculate the scattered field due to the boundary conditions in our geometry. By summing the contribution of the direct or primary field and the indirect field scattered by the boundary, after a careful choice of some expansion expressions, we derive a novel formula of the longitudinal electric field, in any transverse position of the elliptical cross section, generated by the charge moving along the longitudinal axis of the waveguide. The obtained expression is represented in a closed form, it can be differentiated and integrated, it can be used to fully describe the radiation process of a particle beam travelling inside a waveguide of elliptical cross section, and it is valid for any elliptic geometry. The equations are used to evaluate the coupling impedance due to indirect space charge in case of elliptical geometry. In addition, they are useful as preliminary studies for the determination of the coupling impedance in different cases involving elliptic vacuum chambers, as, for example, the effect of the finite conductivity of the beam pipe wall or the geometrical variation of the vacuum chamber due to elliptic step transitions existing in some accelerators.},

Few sources of such FIR radiation currently exist. Superradiant undulator radiation produced at the SUNSHINE (Stanford UNiversity SHort INtense Electron-source) is such a FIR source. First proposed in the mm-wave spectral range by Motz, superradiant undulator radiation has been realized in the 45 um to 300 um spectral range by using sub-picosecond electron bunches produced by the SUNSHINE facility. The experimental setup and measurements of this FIR radiation are reported in this thesis. In addition to being a useful FIR source, the superradiant undulator radiation produced at SUNSHINE is an object of research in itself. Measured superlinear growth of the radiated energy along the undulator demonstrates the self-amplification of radiation by the electron bunch. This superlinear growth is seen at 47 um to 70 um wavelengths. These wavelengths are an order of magnitude shorter than in previous self-amplification demonstrations.},

abstract = {Within the ultrarelativistic limit, analytical expressions are found for the high-frequency resistive-wall coupling impedance of an elliptical cross-section vacuum chamber. Subsequently, the corresponding wake functions are derived by performing inverse Fourier transformations numerically. The electromagnetic fields have been developed working out two systems of solutions, namely for the vacuum and for the resistive wall. The constants involved in these systems have been determined by matching boundary conditions at the interface vacuum wall. Several study cases have been considered concerning the aspect ratio of the elliptical cross section and the transverse position of the leading charge in order to exemplify the behavior of the longitudinal and transverse wake functions. {\textcopyright} 2008 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {General expressions for the complex permeability of ferrites are derived. The imaginary part of this permeability, related to magnetic losses, is of particular interest. It leads to a resistive impedance that extends in frequency as high as {\~{}} 10 GHz. This impedance initially rises with frequency from zero to a maximum and then decreases again due to the decreasing penetration depth. The longitudinal resistive impedance is computed for the ferrites installed in the SPS machine. It amounts to Z/n {\textless} 1 Ω at 1.5 GHz, which is negligible as compared to the measured values of Z/n which range from 20 to more than 30 Ω . The contribution of the ferrites to the imaginary part of longitudinal impedance is computed as well. It is capacitive at 1.5 GHz and its magnitude is of the same order as the resistive part.},

These techniques are applicable to measurement of both fundamental and higher- order mode impedances and allowcharacterization of shunt impedances and quality factors of the HOMs. Methods presented here are complementary to lab bench measurements of RF cavities, in that the beam based measurements directly sense the physical impedance in the installed configuration. In contrast to a single-bunch integrated impedance measurement these techniques resolve the impedances in the frequency domain. These methods allow determination of the impedance's unaliased frequency by analyzing synchronous phase transients. Experimental results from ALS and BESSY-II are presented showing the use of these techniques to measure complex impedances.},

Each of these new machines reached their target specifications without any significant problems. In parallel, already at that time discussions were underway regarding the next generation, the `diffraction-limited light source (DLSR)', which featured sub-nm rad electron beam emittance, photon beam brilliance exceeding 10 {\textless}sup{\textgreater}22{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} and the potential to emit coherent radiation. Also, at about that time, a first design for a 3 GeV DLSR was developed, based on a modified multiple-bend achromat (MBA) design leading to a lattice with normalized emittance of ∊ {\textless}sub{\textgreater} {\textless}italic{\textgreater}x{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = 0.5 nm rad. The novel feature of the MBA lattice was the use of seven vertically focusing bend magnets with different bending angles throughout the achromat cell to keep the radiation integrals and resulting beam emittance low. The baseline design called for a 400 m ring circumference with 12 straight sections of 6 m length. The dynamic aperture behaviour of the DLSR lattice was estimated to produce {\textgreater} 5 h beam lifetime at 100 mA stored beam current. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The NSLS-II storage ring is designed to operate with superconducting RF-cavities with the aim to store an average current of 500 mA distributed in 1080 bunches, with a gap in the uniform filling for ion clearing. At the early stage of the commissioning (phase 1), characterized by a bare lattice without damping wigglers and without Landau cavities, a normal conducting 7-cell PETRA-III RF-cavity structure has been installed with the goal to store an average current of 25 mA. In this paper we discuss our analysis of coupled-bunch instabilities driven by the Higher Order Modes (HOMs) of the 7-cell PETRA-III RF-cavity. As a cure of the instabilities, we apply a well-known scheme based on a proper detuning of the HOMs frequencies based upon cavity temperature change, and the use of the beneficial effect of the slow head-tail damping at positive chromaticity to increase the transverse coupled-bunch instability thresholds. In addition, we discuss measurements of coupled-bunch instabilities observed during the phase 1 commissioning of the NSLS-II storage ring. In our analysis we rely, in the longitudinal case, on the theory of coupled-bunch instability for uniform fillings, while in the transverse case we complement our studies with numerical simulations with OASIS, a novel parallel particle tracking code for self-consistent simulations of collective effects driven by short and long-range wakefields.},

Transient beam loading in the harmonic cavities generated by asym- metries in the fill pattern causes significant variation of the bunch synchronous phase and bunch length along the bunch train when the longitudinal restoring force has been reduced. This results in a significant reduction in the mean bunch lengthening and potential lifetime increase. We describe how beam current modulations give rise to transient effects much larger than expected from the linear model of the beam cavity interaction. We also develop a tracking simulation to predict results and apply this simulation to an analysis of the beam loading transients for the case of passive and active normal and superconducting third harmonic rf systems using Advanced Light Source parameters.},

A positron or proton bunch passing through this ‘‘electron cloud'' experiences a force similar to a short-range wake field. This effective wake field can cause a transverse-mode-coupling instability, if the electron-cloud density exceeds a threshold value. In this report, we compute the electron-cloud induced wake in a region without external magnetic field both analytically and via computer simulation, for parameters representing the low-energy positron ring of KEKB and the LHC proton beam in the CERN SPS. We study the linearity and time dependence of the wake function and its variation with the size of the electron cloud. Using a broadband resonator model for the electron-cloud wake field, we then evaluate theoretical expressions for the transverse- mode-coupling instability based on the linearized Vlasov equation, and for the instability threshold of fast transverse blow up including its dependence on chromaticity.},
